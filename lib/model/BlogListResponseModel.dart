Coming back home, I noticed things that were not on my list, not needed in the truest sense, but I bought them. When wondering why and how this happened &ndash; I realised it was probably due to the placement of products, limited-time offers, encouraging testimonials, or customer reviews. My academic pursuit of behavioural science tells me it is not a coincidence but a time-tested marketing tactic of using nudges.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What are Nudges?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Technically, nudges are persuasive techniques that harness human cognitive biases and decision-making shortcuts to guide people towards specific choices or actions. Nudges are designed to influence behaviour without imposing strict rules or removing options.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s unique is that they predictably influence people&rsquo;s behaviour without restricting their choices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A prevalent nudge is&nbsp;<strong>FOMO</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Fear-of-missing-out).&nbsp;</strong>In this psychological phenomenon, individuals experience anxiety or apprehension when they believe others are participating in rewarding experiences, events, or investments from which they are excluded. It is a potent motivator that drives people to conform, make impulsive decisions, and take unnecessary risks to avoid missing out on potential gains. A survey conducted by a renowned market research firm revealed that 72% of consumers admitted to experiencing FOMO about their personal finances and investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial institutions or companies often capitalise on nudges by creating content showcasing seemingly overnight success stories, extraordinary returns, and exclusive financial products &amp; opportunities. These carefully curated narratives exploit our desire to keep up with others and instil a sense of urgency to participate, regardless of the quality of financial product or our financial suitability &amp; risk appetite.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember, the cryptocurrency space!! It witnessed its fair share of FOMO-induced fervour. With the meteoric rise of digital currencies, stories abound of individuals mortgaging their homes or depleting their life savings to ride the wave of crypto euphoria. The allure of quick riches and tales of overnight millionaires seduced many, often leading to financial ruin when the market inevitably corrects itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Recency bias creates a sense of relevance and attractiveness to potential buyers when dealing with trending products. The &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo; can be risky, as trends may be short-lived or subject to volatility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One more tactic sellers employ is to provide a wide range of investment options, making it seem like abundant choices are available and making buyers feel more comfortable and confident in their decision, even though the actual quality of the products may vary. It becomes evident when one analyses the offerings of various wealth management companies, brokerage firms, or investment platforms that provide numerous options. The sheer variety may overwhelm an investor, making it difficult to assess which products truly align with their goals, leading to decision paralysis or making impulsive choices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, more often than not, the advisor sounds more confident than they are. Given their confidence, one must not forget that any year may wreck an excellent investment strategy, and random strategies may succeed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How do investors react?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors driven by FOMO may make impulsive investment decisions without proper due diligence. They may fail to analyse the cost benefit analysis of the financial products or consider their risk tolerance, investment goals, and the long-term sustainability of the investment, leading to suboptimal outcomes. FOMO-driven investments often result in over-concentration in specific assets and over exposure in expensive, illiquid &amp; under performing investments. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688392938/jdedkzamhju1kujaxfgl.jpg\" style=\"width: 936px; height: 776px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How should investors react?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nudges and FOMO are here to stay. It is a natural human emotion, but managing it is essential to avoid its pitfalls. It is crucial to approach FOMO-driven marketing with a critical mindset. To overcome the potential problems &ndash; transparency, education, and individual empowerment are vital. Individuals should take an active role in their financial decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors should focus on receiving transparent information, personalised advice, and comprehensive risk assessment.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Look beyond the surface-level information provided by sellers and delve into the details.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Evaluate each product&rsquo;s track record, performance, fees, liquidity, tax and risks.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ask financial product sellers to provide expected post expense and post tax return.

Introduction: Importance of Financial Planning</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial planning is the process of setting goals, evaluating your current financial situation, and creating a roadmap to achieve those goals. It helps you make informed decisions about managing your finances, ensuring financial stability, and securing a better future.

Assess Your Current Financial Situation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Before diving into financial planning for 2023, it&rsquo;s important to assess your current financial situation. Evaluate your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Review your bank statements, investment portfolios, and outstanding debts. This assessment will provide a clear picture of where you stand financially and help identify areas that require improvement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Set Clear Financial Goals</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To create a successful financial plan, you need to establish clear and specific goals. Determine what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. It could be saving for a down payment on a house, paying off debt, funding your children&rsquo;s education, or retiring comfortably. Setting goals allows you to prioritize and allocate your resources effectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. Create a Budget</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A budget serves as a roadmap for managing your income and expenses. It helps you track where your money is going and ensures that you allocate sufficient funds towards your financial goals. List all your income sources and categorize your expenses. Identify areas where you can cut back on unnecessary spending and redirect those funds towards your goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5. Manage and Reduce Debt</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Debt can hinder your financial progress and create unnecessary stress. As part of your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alphacapital.in/financial-planning-consultant\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>financial planning in 2023</strong></a>, focus on managing and reducing your debt. Start by organizing your debts, prioritizing them based on interest rates or balances. Explore strategies like debt consolidation or refinancing to simplify your payments and potentially reduce interest costs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">6. Build an Emergency Fund</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An emergency fund is a crucial component of financial planning. It acts as a safety net during unexpected events like job loss, medical emergencies, or major repairs. Aim to save three to six months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible account. Automate your savings by setting up regular contributions to your emergency fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">7. Invest for the Future</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing is an effective way to grow your wealth and achieve long-term financial goals. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives when selecting investment vehicles. Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks and seek professional advice if needed. Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your changing circumstances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">8. Plan for Retirement</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Retirement planning is vital to secure your financial future. Estimate the income you&rsquo;ll need during retirement and calculate the savings required to achieve that goal. Take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, and consider contributing to individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alphacapital.in/financial-advisory-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>financial advisor services</strong></a>&nbsp;to devise a retirement strategy tailored to your needs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">9. Protect Yourself with Insurance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Insurance provides financial protection against unexpected events. Evaluate your insurance coverage, including health, life, disability, and property insurance. Ensure that your coverage is adequate to safeguard your family and assets. Review policies annually to accommodate changes in your circumstances or needs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">10. Review and Adjust Regularly</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial planning is not a one-time task; it requires regular review and adjustments. Set aside time at least once a year to assess your progress, update your goals, and make necessary changes to your financial plan. Keep track of changes in tax laws, market conditions, and personal circumstances that may affect your plan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">11. Seek Professional Guidance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While it&rsquo;s possible to create a financial plan on your own, seeking professional guidance can provide valuable insights and expertise. Consider consulting a certified financial planner (CFP) who can analyse your financial situation, provide personalized recommendations, and help optimize your financial plan for 2023 and beyond.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">12. Tax Planning Strategies</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tax planning is an integral part of financial planning. Understand the tax laws applicable to your country or region and explore strategies to minimize your tax liabilities. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, take advantage of tax deductions and credits, and plan your investments with tax efficiency in mind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">13. Estate Planning</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.alphacapital.in/capabilities/estate-planning-trust-administration\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Estate planning</a></strong>&nbsp;involves the preparation of legal documents to ensure the smooth transfer of assets and wealth to your loved ones after your demise.

While mothers are widely celebrated for their nurturing instincts and tireless dedication, it&rsquo;s time to honour and appreciate fathers&rsquo; notable roles, giving a lifetime of lessons.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Father&rsquo;s Day is an opportunity to express gratitude for their unwavering love, guidance, and support. This year, let&rsquo;s celebrate fathers for their emotional presence and the financial wisdom they impart. They have always empowered us to make informed financial decisions by teaching kids about personal finance and setting us on the path to financial independence. A father&rsquo;s commitment to a family&rsquo;s financial security and dedication to building a legacy is commendable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fathers are important role models and often the first financial mentors we encounter. From a young age, they teach us the value of saving, the importance of delayed gratification, and the rewards of hard work. Whether through an allowance or small entrepreneurial endeavours like a lemonade stand, they instil in us the concept of earning and budgeting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As we grow older, they guide us through the maze of financial decisions, helping us understand the significance of investments, retirement planning, and debt management. Be it a successful businessman who has built his empire from scratch, ensuring financial stability and prosperity for his family. He has taught his kids the power of compounding, saving, and different investment avenues&rsquo; risks and rewards. Today, his children have grown up financially responsible individuals who continue building on their Father&rsquo;s legacy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fathers are the pillars of financial responsibility, leading by example and teaching us the importance of making sound financial choices. They emphasize the significance of living within our means, avoiding unnecessary debt, and building an emergency fund. Their practical approach to money management fosters a sense of responsibility and self-discipline within us, creating a solid foundation for our financial future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fathers&rsquo; impact on their children&rsquo;s financial journey extends beyond numbers and investments. Fathers inspire us to work hard, be disciplined, and strive for financial independence. They encourage us to embrace an entrepreneurial spirit, teaching us to take calculated risks and seize opportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moreover, fathers often play a pivotal role in estate planning and ensuring a smooth transfer of wealth to the next generation.

However, the astute investor recognizes a unique opportunity during such a transition and potential disruption. One can reap substantial rewards by embracing the challenge and investing with confidence. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There is no debate that investing in the stock market with a long-term perspective is generally prudent. However, investors can benefit from any positive sentiment and market rallies leading up to the event by investing before the election. Though timing the market is challenging, elections provide a clear timeline for potential market movements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>&ldquo;The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious.&rdquo; &ndash; John Sculley.</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over the long term, stock markets have generally exhibited positive returns despite short-term volatility related to elections. Investing one year before elections makes investors more likely to capture the potential long-term gains the stock market has historically offered. While past performance does not indicate future results, historical market trends can provide insights. We can explore general trends and patterns that may support this investment strategy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Historical data suggests that stock markets have generally performed well in election years. In the US, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 index has shown positive returns in 18 of 23 presidential election years, with an average annual return of 6.5%, highlighting the potential for positive market performance during election years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Indian stock markets have also experienced positive trends in the pre-election period. For example, in the run-up to the 2014 general elections, the BSE Sensex, the benchmark index of the Indian stock market, witnessed a significant rally in the three months leading up to the election results announcement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687764145/y3eanvbrguii6evxkiey.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 263px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">*Adjusted for Covid Impact; Returns (expressed in terms of %)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stock markets have typically exhibited stability following elections, which can provide a favourable environment for investors who remain invested after the elections.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Post the elections government outlines its agenda and priorities, bringing about policy clarity. This clarity instils confidence in investors and businesses, increasing investment and economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A study published in The Journal of Finance found that investor sentiment and market returns are positively influenced by the clarity of political outcomes, which tends to improve in the period following elections.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For instance, during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, the stock market showed significant volatility in the weeks leading up to the election. As the results became apparent, the market rallied on the back of the decisive mandate that the ruling party received. The market sentiment was positive, as investors expected the government to continue its economic reforms and policies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, if the election results are unexpected or if there is a hung parliament, the market can show significant volatility. But, volatility is not always bad, as it can sometimes provide entry points from which investors can take advantage. Downward market volatility offers investors who believe markets will perform well, in the long run, to buy additional stocks in companies they like at lower prices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One can also observe that the stock market&rsquo;s performance before and after the election results can vary widely. For example, during the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the market saw significant gains in the year leading up to the election but saw a sharp decline after the results were announced.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the market saw a significant decline before the results but gained after the election. It is also interesting to note that the elections tend to have a long-term impact on the stock market, as seen in the 2-year returns column. On average, the stock market saw a 41.1% return over two years after the election.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One can discern several factors influencing investors to strategically decide while investing in the stock market before the elections and remain invested for at least a year after the elections, if not more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Elections often create short-term volatility and uncertainty in the market. However, as the election approaches, the market tends to stabilize, driven by a clearer understanding of the political landscape. By investing before the election, investors can position themselves to benefit from any positive market sentiment shifts and potential market rallies that may follow once the outcome is known.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Elections often bring policy reforms and initiatives that can impact specific sectors and industries. By investing before the election, investors can position themselves to take advantage of potential sector-specific opportunities that may arise from the proposed policies of different political parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Not only do the policies impact the markets directly, but it also influences the value of the Indian rupee in the foreign exchange market. If investors perceive the election outcome positively, it can increase foreign capital inflows, strengthening the currency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors who invest in Indian stocks can benefit from potential rupee appreciation, which can enhance their returns. Over the years, investor confidence in the Indian economy has been increasing. The inflow of foreign institutional investments (FIIs) into Indian equities has been substantial, indicating growing confidence in the country&rsquo;s economic prospects. A positive election outcome can further bolster investor confidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One cannot ignore that India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with a growing middle class and a large consumer base. Investing in the stock market now can expose investors to the long-term growth potential of Indian companies and sectors. As the economy continues to expand, well-positioned investments can potentially deliver significant returns over the long term. Moreover, investors can identify sectors and position themselves to benefit from the proposed policies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Legendary investor Warren Buffett once said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This sentiment rings especially true before union elections. While some may adopt a wait-and-see approach, a successful investor would understand the significance of taking action in the present.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To conclude, one must remember that it is crucial to distinguish between short-term fluctuations and long-term value, primarily when investing before elections. While the market sentiment may temporarily sway, focusing on the underlying fundamentals and the true intrinsic value of the investments you consider is essential. By conducting thorough research and relying on sound analysis, you can make informed decisions that will withstand the test of time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">My dear readers, remember that elections may create temporary waves. Still, they also present fertile ground for discerning investors to plant the seeds of wealth. And like when you plant mango seeds in the garden, you don&rsquo;t dig them up daily to see if they have sprouted yet. Nonetheless, you don&rsquo;t just guard or conserve it. You water it. You care for it, so it grows. Later, you eat the fruit (Mango) and take out the seeds to plant more trees using them because you have to reinvest. That&rsquo;s where the wealth lies!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, make your sound investment decisions based on well-researched information and let the tree give your fruits of wealth. Meanwhile, you can enjoy eating Mango, the king of fruits this season.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687764398/wvrdmrzqrze6domn4nj4.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Seizing the Opportunity: Investing with Confidence Before Union Elections","seo_keywords":"Seizing the Opportunity: Investing with Confidence Before Union Elections","seo_description":"There is no debate that investing in the stock market with a long-term perspective is generally prudent.

He said he would put all his savings in it if that were possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I tried to persuade the client to invest in the equity asset class for a long-term horizon, but he only had eyes for PPF. It&rsquo;s not fair to compare them because they are different asset classes with different roles in a portfolio. The only thing they have in common is that they are both long-term investment tools. But what about their long-term returns? PPF gives an 8% post-tax return, while the equity asset class can give around a 12% post-tax return in general. This leads us to the questions:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Does the extra 4% return from equity compensate for its volatility?</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do we forgo the security of government-backed bonds?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">New investors may not find equity a convincing alternative to PPF, even with a 4% higher return, given the uncertainty and risk involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s make a stronger case for equity. A 4% extra return may not seem like much, but when you compound it over 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 years, it makes a huge difference. Here is the calculation:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687764600/bawufv4ep7fxroohb7zj.jpg\" style=\"width: 826px; height: 202px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The chart illustrates how the gap widens as the years go by. In 10 years, the difference is only 9 lakhs, but in 50 years, it is 24 crores. This difference can make or break one&rsquo;s wealth and lifestyle. This is why people with similar incomes end up living very differently. One travels within the country, while the other goes abroad. One drives an ordinary car, while the other drives a luxury car, and so on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You must also consider that inflation erodes the value of money over time, and PPF barely manages to outperform inflation. So PPF investors are only maintaining their purchasing power without creating wealth. Their lifestyle remains unchanged. Please note that we are talking about PPF, which is the best of the best in the fixed income category because it offers a slightly higher and tax-free rate than fixed deposits (FDs). Fixed deposits, on the other hand, have lower rates than PPF and are fully taxable. So FDs would not even keep up with inflation, let alone generate wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As for the volatility of equity, it is a natural characteristic of the equity market to respond to events. It plunges on bad news and surges on good news. There is always some obstacle or challenge in the economy that scares investors away. Crises also keep occurring, such as the subprime crisis in 2008, the Euro crisis in 2011, the Chinese crisis in 2015, and COVID in 2020. But these are all temporary phenomena.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The equity market will always recover and rise. The Sensex has gone up from 5000 in January 2000 to 62000 in May 2023. This is an 11.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).

Mutual funds are not products that generate fixed income. They are risky, and market circumstances influence their performance. Furthermore, past results do not guarantee future results. As a result, while analysing a mutual fund, one must consider factors like asset allocation, investment strategy, and other factors, giving a more complete picture of the fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Performance evaluation of mutual funds is an essential aspect of investing in them. Evaluating mutual fund performance requires a comprehensive analysis of historical performance, fund manager track record, investment philosophy, degree of diversification, investment style and expense ratio and risk-adjusted returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, the world of finance is loaded with technical concepts and complicated terminology. In some cases, the words may sound impressive; in others, they are intimidating or confusing. Worse, some of the vocabulary isn&rsquo;t what it sounds like. Financial jargon can make it difficult for investors to understand the underlying concepts, leading to confusion. As a result, it is essential to simplify financial jargon and provide clear explanations for novice investors to understand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article attempts to demystify some basic measures of mutual fund performance that can help make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes. Without performance evaluation, one is often in the dark about their investment&rsquo;s true value and the associated risks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As stated by Bill McNabb, the world&rsquo;s largest mutual fund manager,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Measuring performance is not just about returns; it&rsquo;s about assessing how much risk was taken to achieve those returns.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s start with risk, as it naturally comes to the forefront when evaluating mutual fund performance. Various risk measures, such as standard deviation, Beta, R-squared, and maximum drawdown, are employed to assess the level of risk undertaken.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Standard Deviation&nbsp;</strong>measures the degree to which the fund&rsquo;s returns have varied from the average return over a specific period. A higher standard deviation means that the fund&rsquo;s returns have fluctuated more, indicating a higher level of risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Beta</strong>&nbsp;measures the fund&rsquo;s sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1.0 means that the fund moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1.0 indicates that the fund is more volatile than the market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>R-Squared</strong>&nbsp;measures the degree to which the fund&rsquo;s performance is explained by its benchmark index. A higher R-squared means the fund&rsquo;s performance is more closely tied to its benchmark. In contrast, a lower R-squared indicates that other factors drive the fund&rsquo;s performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Maximum Drawdown</strong>&nbsp;measures the largest loss the fund has experienced from its peak value to its lowest value during a specific period. A higher maximum drawdown indicates that the fund has experienced larger losses, indicating higher risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We all want significant returns with little risk, which makes analysing risk-adjusted returns vital in mutual fund investing. They provide a more accurate picture of the fund&rsquo;s performance than just looking at raw returns. Raw returns do not consider the amount of risk assumed to achieve those returns. Mutual funds invest in various assets, including stocks, bonds, and other securities, carrying different levels of risk. Risk-adjusted returns provide a measure of how much return an investor is receiving per unit of risk taken.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Analysing risk-adjusted returns help in comparing the performance of different mutual funds with similar investment objectives and asset allocations. Suppose two mutual funds have the same raw return, but one has a lower risk-adjusted return. In that case, the fund with the lower risk-adjusted return takes on more risk to achieve the same return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some of the measures of risk-adjusted returns are Jensen&rsquo;s Alpha, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Sortino ratio and Information ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Jensen Alpha</strong>, also known as the Jensen&rsquo;s Performance Index, was developed by Michael Jensen in 1968. The metric measures a portfolio&rsquo;s excess return over the expected return based on its Beta (systematic risk) and the market risk premium (the difference between the expected return on the market portfolio and the risk-free rate). This measures the fund&rsquo;s excess return relative to its benchmark index. A positive Jensen Alpha indicates that the portfolio has outperformed its expected return given its level of systematic risk. In other words, a positive alpha suggests that the fund has outperformed its benchmark index, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Sharpe Ratio</strong>&nbsp;was developed by Nobel laureate William Sharpe in 1966. The ratio measures a portfolio&rsquo;s excess return over the risk-free rate (G sec rate) per unit of volatility or risk (as measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio&rsquo;s returns). The Sharpe ratio measures a fund&rsquo;s excess return per unit of total risk. It is calculated as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return &ndash; Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the portfolio&rsquo;s risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio is more appropriate for evaluating the performance of all types of mutual funds, including those with low or non-existent beta values, such as bond funds or fixed-income funds. The Sharpe ratio can also help compare funds with different investment styles or evaluate a fund&rsquo;s performance over shorter periods.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Treynor ratio&nbsp;</strong>was developed by Jack Treynor in 1965. It measures a portfolio&rsquo;s excess return over the risk-free rate per unit of systematic risk (as measured by the portfolio&rsquo;s beta). Systematic risk is the risk that a diversified portfolio cannot diversify away.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Treynor Ratio = (Portfolio Return &ndash; Risk-Free Rate) / Beta</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The higher the Treynor Ratio, the better the portfolio&rsquo;s risk-adjusted performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The only difference between the Sharpe ratio and Treynor is the risk measure. Therefore, the Treynor ratio is most appropriate for evaluating the performance of well-diversified portfolios with exposure to systematic risk. It is most useful when comparing mutual funds with similar investment styles or when assessing the performance of a single fund over a long period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Sortino Ratio</strong>&nbsp;is similar to the Sharpe Ratio but only considers downside risk. It measures the excess return of the fund relative to the downside deviation of its returns. It is calculated by dividing the excess return of an investment over the risk-free rate by the downside deviation of the investment. The downside deviation is calculated by measuring only the negative returns or returns below a specified threshold.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sortino Ratio = (Portfolio Return &ndash; Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A higher Sortino ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns. The Sortino ratio is beneficial for evaluating investments that have significant downside risk. For example, it may be appropriate to use the Sortino ratio to assess the performance of a hedge fund or other investment strategy that seeks to limit downside risk. By focusing only on the downside deviation of returns, the Sortino ratio provides a more accurate picture of how well an investment manages risk concerning its returns. Therefore, more risk-averse investors often use it to avoid assets with high downside risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Information Ratio</strong>&nbsp;measures the risk-adjusted excess return of a fund relative to a benchmark. It compares the fund&rsquo;s excess return to the tracking error or the difference between its and benchmark returns. A higher Information Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The information ratio is best used when evaluating actively managed funds or portfolios designed to outperform a benchmark. The information ratio helps to determine whether a fund is generating excess returns relative to its benchmark and whether this outperformance is due to skill or luck. The higher the information ratio, the more likely the fund&rsquo;s outperformance is due to skill. Therefore, it is often used by investors seeking active management and looking to evaluate the performance of their fund managers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Other than focusing on risk and return, analysing the fees and expenses associated with the fund is essential to ensure they are reasonable and do not eat into the investor&rsquo;s returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The expense ratio</strong>&nbsp;of a mutual fund is an essential factor to consider when evaluating its performance because it represents the fund&rsquo;s annual operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and other expenses. Thus, the expense ratio is the annual fee charged by the fund manager to manage the fund. It is expressed as a percentage of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management. A high expense ratio can eat into the fund&rsquo;s returns, reducing the overall performance for investors. A lower expense ratio is generally better because it leaves more money in the fund to be invested. Over time, even minor differences in expense ratios can significantly impact returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the increasing popularity of index funds, it is vital to build the right toolkit for analysing them. In addition to the above-mentioned risk and return measures, investors should look for tracking error and turnover ratios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Tracking Error</strong>&nbsp;measures how closely the fund tracks its benchmark index. It is calculated by taking the difference between the fund&rsquo;s and the benchmark index&rsquo;s returns. A lower tracking error indicates that the fund is doing a better job of tracking the index.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Turnover Ratio</strong>&nbsp;measures how frequently the fund&rsquo;s holdings are bought and sold. It is expressed as a percentage of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management. A higher turnover ratio can result in higher transaction costs and capital gains taxes, eroding returns over time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These measures are all used but differ in the emphasis given under different situations. For example, the Sharpe ratio is suitable for investors concerned about downside risk and who want to minimise the probability of negative returns. On the other hand, the Treynor ratio is helpful for investors concerned about their investments&rsquo; systematic risk. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the choice of the best measure for MF risk-adjusted performance depends on various factors such as the investment objective, investment horizon, risk tolerance, and investment style of an individual investor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After reading this article, I don&rsquo;t want you to evaluate your investment every day or whenever the market crashes. Remember, markets move in cycles. Only when you invest long, you can expect to see significant profits. As a result, you should evaluate and study the performance of your mutual funds every six months to a year. As thematic or sectoral funds are more vulnerable to market conditions, you may need to review them more frequently than other funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Keep a look out for funds that are underperforming the benchmark. Before you decide to exit, monitor the performance of such funds for two to three quarters. An extended period of underperformance hints that you should sell your investment. It would be best if you also comprehended the cause of such underperformance. The fund management routinely buys and sells equities, altering the portfolio&rsquo;s makeup and risks. The risk parameters are critical for assessing the performance of a fund. If the fund&rsquo;s risk profile has drifted further towards &lsquo;High&rsquo; risk while returns have stayed constant or declined, it may be advisable to quit the fund. Furthermore, funds that perform well today may not generate significant returns in the future. As a result, you should review your portfolio regularly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To conclude, with the words of the Oracle of Omaha:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&ldquo;Investing without evaluation is like driving with your eyes closed.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So my dear readers, Enjoy being in the driving seat on the journey of financial prosperity!!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687765712/oucizladiq5hlmcuqlgj.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Performance evaluation of Mutual funds","seo_keywords":"Performance evaluation of Mutual funds","seo_description":"We’re all familiar with this caveat.

Let&rsquo;s do some math for different income levels and compare the taxation in both tax regimes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The following would be taxes in the new tax regime for various income levels:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687769061/bnleprgjma0shvvwn7pb.jpg\" style=\"width: 841px; height: 334px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To calculate tax under the old tax regime, let us presume that an individual is savvy with deductions and exemptions and avails of the standard deduction of Rs. 50,000. He can also get a deduction of Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C, Rs. 25000 under Section 80D, and Rs. 50000 under the National Pension System (NPS). So the total tax deduction is Rs. 2.75 lakh.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The following would be taxes in the old tax regime for various income levels:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687769111/fnhd1cpvrccmnkp14kxr.jpg\" style=\"width: 841px; height: 397px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You can see that in most cases, the new tax regime is better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But what if you also get a 2-lakh deduction for home loan interest the old way?

May the best team win the league.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But what about the investing game? How do you succeed in this investing game? What does winning in investing even mean? Is it earning outstanding returns or beating the market? Or Financial independence?<br />\r\nInvesting is a game. It&rsquo;s just not the one you think it is. Investing is an infinite game.<br />\r\nPhilosopher James Carse&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Finite and Infinite Games,&rdquo; in 1986, established that two types of games unfold in the world: finite and infinite. Examples of finite games include chess, football, or a game of Monopoly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687772651/boaa4xjhvcwoorjjux9e.jpg\" style=\"width: 994px; height: 67px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2019, Simon Sinek published his business book,&nbsp;<em>The Infinite Game</em>, as a mindset guide for business leaders. An infinite game is not bound by a specific set of rules or conditions but has an open-ended and ongoing nature. It is a game played to continue playing rather than striving to reach a particular outcome or endpoint. Examples of infinite games include language, education, business, and relationships, with no set endpoint, specific winner, or clear rules.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial planning deceptively looks like a finite game. You know your current financial position and have well-defined financial goals. You know the game&rsquo;s rules &ndash; Spend less, save more, and invest well. Thus it should be simple, but it&rsquo;s not. Financial planning goalposts move with your life. After accomplishing one milestone, you can see another. Rules change based on your circumstances. How much money you must save, invest, earn, and use is subjective. It depends on your ever-evolving goals, personal priorities, and what you want to do with your time and energy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Furthermore, investing has no end date or predetermined outcome. In an infinite game of investing, the focus is on the process of making investments rather than on the immediate gains or losses. Investors are constantly seeking new opportunities and adapting to changes in the market to ensure continued success over the long term. Investing aims to create and maintain wealth over time by learning and adapting to changing market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors need to be patient, persistent, and adaptable to changes in the market. They must also be able to manage risk and maintain a diversified portfolio to maximize returns over the long term. Ultimately, the goal is not to beat the market or achieve a specific rate of return but to build a strong and resilient portfolio that can weather market fluctuations and generate consistent returns over time. Successful investors view investing as a journey rather than a destination. They always look for ways to improve their strategies and achieve better outcomes. There are known and unknown variables in the game that will impact results.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When investing, you must participate in the market with your number-one priority set to continue participating for as long as possible. That&rsquo;s the only way compound returns can work for you. That&rsquo;s the only way you exponentially grow wealth. Stay in the game as long as possible. Give yourself every opportunity to continue to play.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687772698/ejqssk8z5rxbpvgppl0p.jpg\" style=\"width: 964px; height: 676px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be a good player in this infinite game.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Don&rsquo;t view yourself only as a winner or loser but as a wealth creator &ndash; for yourself and future generations.

Households, automobiles, factories, and financial markets all produce noise. Contrary to popular belief, noises are not bad; rather, they deliver information. For example, a noise from your car may inform you about the bad condition of the vehicle. Similarily, noises from your bathroom tap can inform you about a leak.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Noises are information, but in financial markets they are not. Market noise is an informal term for the volatility that results primarily from news broadcast by well-known business news networks. Positive and negative news always have an impact on markets because humans are emotion-driven. They forget the fact that these financial market news stories are nothing but illogical hype that could lead to irrational investor behavior in the market. Moreover, the markets will, sooner or later, correct those irrational price moves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Market news is the &lsquo;product&rsquo; sold by financial news networks. As everyday noises may distract you, market noises can also influence your investment decision or distract you from your financial goal. The majority of the information or news that is floating in the market is just noise. The issue is that noise spreads much more quickly than relevant information. It is very challenging to separate the genuine information from the noise and signal overload.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>How to tune out the market noise</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In this age of lightning-fast information exchange, investors must protect themselves from market noise. There are several ways to do that.<br />\r\nTime is an inevitable tool to ward off market noise. By increasing the time frame, you can effectively reduce the impact of market noise on your investments. As exposure to market data or perspectives is reduced, the most pertinent details become more apparent. For instance, you should cut back on how often you check things like the stock market, market news, and your portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another good way to filter out market noise is to only pay attention to the most important things that happen on the markets and ignore the rest. For example, recent noteworthy market developments include the market correction followed by the Corona pandemic, policy shifts by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and the passing of the Finance Bill for the Debt Fund, Gold Funds, Funds of Funds, and Global Fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Market noises are good at times</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">At times, market noise is good for us. As investors, we get the chance to enter the market by either investing more, rebalancing the portfolio, or simply booking profits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Your financial advisor plays a crucial role in helping you cut through all the noise. He or she advises you to take appropriate action as per your financial goals and plans while guiding you through crises. An intelligent investor never goes with the flow of the noise; he will always keep his mind open for valid market signals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Neeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687773079/pg86g0oxubnnvj8aed1c.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Noises are information, but market noises aren’t","seo_keywords":"Noises are information, but market noises aren’t","seo_description":"Noises are everywhere.

Similarily, noises from your bathroom tap can inform you about a leak.","seo_blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687773076/ds6tq5jghyvvlvgkyjsv.jpg","created_at":"Jun 26, 2023"},{"blog_id":"13","title":"The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable: Credit Suisse","slug":"theknowntheunknownandtheunknowablecreditsuisse","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1679565229","published_date_view":"Mar 23, 2023","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The collapse of Silicone Valley bank and Signature Bank in the US and Credit Suisse&rsquo;s emergency merger with UBS Group AG this week has shaken the world. Herd psychology is a force in the fast-moving world of financial markets.&nbsp;The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, two much smaller regional lenders, shook investor confidence worldwide.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Credit Suisse, the giant 167-year-old European bank, Switzerland&rsquo;s second-largest bank by assets, is a &ldquo;global systemically important bank&rdquo; (or &ldquo;G-SIB&rdquo;) and is very different from the two US banks. Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Credit Suisse operates wealth management, investment banking, and asset management in Switzerland. By 2021, it employed over 50,000 people and managed 1.6 trillion Swiss francs. With over 150 offices in around 50 countries, Credit Suisse is the private bank for many entrepreneurs, wealthy, and ultra-rich individuals and companies.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;failure is feared to cause global ripples through the entire financial system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">UBS, Switzerland&rsquo;s largest bank, agreed to buy its embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) as part of a government-backed, cut-price deal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687773485/evgtbqvcg8zaiybitmzy.png\" style=\"width: 936px; height: 522px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Switzerland is a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy. The merger of these two banks concentrates even more significant risks into one banking behemoth, UBS Group AG. Also, this event appears to have damaged Switzerland&rsquo;s reputation for stability and got a tag of &ldquo;a financial banana republic.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687773526/fsqkofzpc2dtecq7f6cv.png\" style=\"width: 882px; height: 618px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many say that the collapse of Credit Suisse was in the offing for a long time, owing to a series of high-profile scandals (money laundering by drug dealers) and financial losses (Archegos hedge fund scandal in 2021). When its top investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it could not provide any more financial assistance, the investor and consumer confidence was shaken, and concerns were amplified. The winding up of SVB and Signature bank heightened the scrutiny over a bank reeling under tremendous pressure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When the financial regulator FINMA became the first to rescue a globally systemically important bank, the Swiss government and Swiss National Bank (SNB) joined in. There is a striking similarity in how bondholders faced losses in this case. AT1 bond investments worth roughly 16 billion Swiss francs will become worthless (something similar happened with Yes Bank investors three years ago)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">AT1 (Additional Tier 1) bonds are a debt instrument banks issue to meet their regulatory capital requirements under Basel III, an international regulatory framework for banks. These bonds are also perpetual or contingent convertible bonds (CoCos). AT1 bonds are considered hybrid capital with debt and equity features. They are perpetual, meaning they have no maturity date. They offer higher yields than traditional bonds due to their higher risk profile.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One unique feature of AT1 bonds is that they can be converted into equity or written off if the issuer&rsquo;s capital falls below a certain level, known as the trigger point. This makes them riskier than traditional bonds, as investors are exposed to the risk of a write-off or conversion to equity. Overall, AT1 bonds are complex financial instruments that require careful consideration by investors due to their unique features and risk profile.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Equity instruments are generally considered riskier than debt instruments because equity investors have no guarantee of getting their money back. However, there are cases where a debt instrument can have more risk than an equity instrument. Subordinated debt is a type of debt that ranks lower in priority than other debt in the event of bankruptcy. If the company defaults on debt, subordinated debt investors may not receive their money back. As a result, subordinated debt can be riskier than equity, which ranks higher in priority.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Convertible debt is a type of debt that can be converted into equity under certain conditions. While this feature can make the convertible debt more attractive to investors, it also introduces additional risk. Suppose the company&rsquo;s stock price falls below the conversion price. In that case, the debt may not be converted, and investors may be left with a lower-value debt instrument.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">High-yield or junk bonds are debt instruments rated below investment grade by credit rating agencies. These bonds offer higher yields to compensate for the increased risk of default. However, high-yield bonds can be riskier than equity in some cases, as their value can decline significantly in the event of a default or credit downgrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember, debt is not always risk-free. Make a wise risk-return tradeoff decision with the understanding that very low probability events not only can happen, but they absolutely will happen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In this turn of events, Saudi National Bank, AT1 Bondholders, Swiss authorities, and taxpayers are all on the losing side of the deal, as markets appear to be in &ldquo;seek and destroy mode.&rdquo; The world is witnessing a spectacular collapse for a 166-year-old bank and the third major bank collapse in two weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We don&rsquo;t know when and where the markets will stop. What Fed has in store!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All we know is advanced contingency planning is needed to manage this situation. One needs to learn to embrace uncertainity, be more flexible and adaptive. Scenario planning is vital as it helps prepare for many potential outcomes. One may discover dangers and opportunities and create solutions by visualizing&nbsp;alternative scenarios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Unknown As we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know There are known unknowns. That is to say; We know there are some things We do not know.

This workable plan is known as strategic estate planning services, and it is a significant branch of wealth management and financial planning. Unfortunately, most families only understand the importance of estate planning once things get out of hand. After a family member&rsquo;s demise, legal cases arise, including fights for wealth possession.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Estate planning ensures that your wealth is safe and transferred to the right beneficiary, even in your absence. Most people, at most times, are busy acquiring a lot of assets like fleets of cars and properties. It is joyful to admire the rewards of your hard work, but at the same time, it would be saddening to watch your wealth fall into the wrong hands. Without meticulous estate planning, you cannot decide who has access to your wealth and how they handle it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, you don&rsquo;t need to be a millionaire to seek the services of an estate planner.

They allow their clients to transfer their assets after they are no more. Moreover, estate planning services are essential to secure your wealth and assets after death or incapacitation. The estate planner oversees the entire process and ensures entrusting the right trustee through proper will documentation. They also give the freedom for clients to pick either Living Trust or Testamentary Trust.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Living Trust is one of the strategic estate planning services that allow the beneficiaries to access the wealth of the trustee even after a stipulated time during his lifetime. In other words, the trust would be active even when the client is still alive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, a testamentary trust transfers the ownership of wealth only after the trustee&rsquo;s death.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every wealthy family fear estate tax payment. Nobody likes to accumulate a lot of liabilities in the form of taxes. An estate planner helps the family or client in their tax planning, including handling the probate process. In addition, they set up strategies that can reduce the expenses made on estate taxes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some top estate tax reduction strategies include</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A-B trusts</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Charity Donations</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Freezing estates</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Supporting the estate planning process with life insurance</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>The Elements of Estate Planning</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Understanding some significant financial or estate planning elements is essential before you pick an estate planning service or any financial service. An estate planning service goes beyond drafting and documenting a trust or a will. Numerous elements make a complete strategic estate planning service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Four crucial elements of estate planning include</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Will or Trust</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wills and trusts are documented reports which show how to transfer all your assets. It is one of the most significant elements of financial and estate planning. These documents ensure clarity and transparency as they enlist every beneficiary of your wealth and assets with their proportion for each individual.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Planning and drafting a will or trust is critical for every individual or family. There will be doubts about what must be given out to each person and how it is done. Clearing these doubts is crucial to avoid family feuds when the head of the family is no more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from these doubts and skepticism, there are chances for many challenges to arise, mainly when the will and trust are ill-drafted. Therefore, you should seek the services of an estate planner to avoid all these challenges and doubts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Power of Attorney</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is always better to entrust a power of attorney over a third party, either an individual or an agent, to help you carry out the estate planning processes when you are no more. Families must have a power of attorney as it keeps their assets secured even after the head of the family is no more. In addition, without a power of attorney, the court couldn&rsquo;t decide over the wealth transfer or what will happen to a person&rsquo;s wealth after their demise.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are two significant types of power of attorney: healthcare and financial. The healthcare power of attorney gives a person the authority to make healthcare decisions after the demise of the family head. In contrast, the financial power of attorney gives someone similar authority over financial decisions when the family head is no more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Target Beneficiary</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Target beneficiaries include all parties and individuals that will benefit from your wealth and assets. For example, some wills and trusts make provisions to consider your wards as beneficiaries. In addition, every involved party should make the decisions for guardianship designations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Letter of Intent</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The letter of intent is handed over to the beneficiaries, stating their share and responsibilities over your wealth and assets. This letter also clearly states what you expect from them even in your absence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The estate planning process is often overlooked, and its benefits are ignored. Although the process seems as simple as a wealth transfer, it should not be taken as simple. There is much more to it than transferring and allocating wealth among friends and family. It ensures the assets are properly divided and handed over to the beneficiaries in case of temporary or permanent incapacitation. Moreover, everything should be done abiding by the law of the country.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You must pick a personalized estate planning service to eliminate the risk of making wrong wealth management decisions. Several multifamily offices today are committed to helping you build the right estate planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687775014/eyvgm0mxsjnlfilpvoit.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Everything You Need to Know About Strategic Estate Planning","seo_keywords":"Everything You Need to Know About Strategic Estate Planning","seo_description":"Wise investors always have a workable plan to deal with their wealth when they are no more or incapable of managing it.

The answer is no, and the family office industry will continue to grow worldwide.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is not an overly optimistic view.

The report predicts that the millionaire population in India will experience a growth of more than 100% by 2026.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Shifting Financial Landscape</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Clients now expect their advisors to handle their portfolios comprehensively, considering factors such as their family situation, background, aspirations, and goals. Family offices offering personalized services are well-equipped to cater to these evolving demands.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, running a family office is an expensive undertaking. There are operational costs and salaries for professionals, compliance officers, and legal counsel to consider, which is why liquidity of at least $100 million is regarded as the minimum requirement to make a family office financially viable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family offices with established infrastructure and sunk costs incur lower costs to onboard new clients, lowering the barrier of entry and allowing the family offices to capture a larger market share.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Amid these challenging times, clients and prospective clients of the wealth management industry have expressed their admiration for family offices. Moreover, it is believed that once the crisis is over, the reputation of family offices will be even stronger, attracting even more wealth and resources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over the past two decades, the wealth explosion in Asia has been nothing short of remarkable, with 182 new billionaires being recorded in Mainland China in 2019 alone, according to the latest Hurun&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3052462/china-produces-182-new-billionaires-triple-new-faces-us-while\">report</a>. This has fuelled the boom of family offices in Asia, outpacing North America.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Constantly Evolving Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But what exactly is a family office, and how does it stand out in such a crowded space? A family office is a centralized hub for a family&rsquo;s financial and operational administration. Although it may seem straightforward on the surface, the reality of this sector is much more complex. The family office landscape is constantly evolving, and change is necessary for growth; without change, there will only be obsolescence. Therefore, family offices must be flexible, agile, and decisive, constantly adapting to the families they serve. As a result, family office options for new and upcoming generations will be more diverse, personalized, and exciting than ever.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family offices must strive to stay ahead of the curve and lead the wealth management industry. However, despite the recent surge in family offices and their services, there is still a lack of true independence in acting solely in the client&rsquo;s best interest. Currently, most traditional family offices offer limited services and may need help to meet the comprehensive needs of their clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Fam-Tech</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As technology and digitalization continue to shape our daily lives, the demand for innovative and alternative wealth management solutions grows. In addition, with many families undergoing a transition between generations, it is crucial to ensure this process is as seamless as possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealth management must be approached differently; an account here and an investment there just won&rsquo;t cut it. Coordinated and active investment management with comprehensive planning is essential. Therefore, a family office must partner with a data aggregator provider to provide consolidated statements across various assets for clients and relationship managers, giving them a clear and comprehensive view of their portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Families are now seeking customized solutions and structures for wealth preservation, proper succession planning, and family governance, considering intangible factors such as establishing family trusts or foundational structures, legacy planning, education, philanthropic activities, and other ad-hoc services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Points to Ponder</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When setting up an effective family office, there are three key considerations:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First, what services does the family require?</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Second, what is their financial and non-financial asset management goals?</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Third, is it feasible to fund the setup and operations of the family office?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The goal of a family office is to manage wealth across generations efficiently and effectively, preserving and protecting it to prevent its dissipation. Thus, the ability to identify problems and areas of concern is critical to the establishment of a successful family office. Then, working with professional parties and consultants with expertise in their fields, families can get answers and tailored solutions, providing value that cannot be found in traditional wealth management organizations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A family office must align its interests with its clients to ensure cost-effectiveness, maximum efficiency, and minimize conflicts. This results in families being able to focus on crucial structural planning and governance, leading to the achievement of their end goals. The aim of a family office must be to create actual value for its clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family wealth management requires a specialized approach due to its complexity, encompassing the business and managing various financial aspects like liquidity, investments, and assets. In short, a family office is a solution to support a family&rsquo;s financial needs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Five P&rsquo;s for Setting up a Family Office</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Personalization: The family office is customized to meet the needs of a single client &ndash; the family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Privacy: A family office provides a secure place for personal information that is only accessible to a select few. It acts as a guardian of the family&rsquo;s privacy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Prosperity: Family wealth is spread among different generations with varying needs, and a family office helps balance wealth creation with their financial needs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Perpetuity: The family office supports the family in creating a legacy that lasts across generations by defining a clear family purpose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Professionalism: The trend toward professional management of family wealth is increasing. A family office can provide a dedicated team of experts to manage the family&rsquo;s finances professionally, especially as family wealth and businesses become more global.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Managing family wealth is a delicate and intricate task, encompassing not just the family business but also balancing liquidity ratios, private equity investments, stock portfolios, debt structures, and even personal assets. To tackle these unique challenges, a family office is a bespoke solution providing comprehensive support for the family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687776162/rb71n6plgvtoag5ptisk.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Relevance of Family Office","seo_keywords":"The Relevance of Family Office","seo_description":"This is not an overly optimistic view.

For instance, youngsters have a lower risk-taking ability but a high willingness. On the other hand, senior citizens have the high risk-taking ability but exhibit lower willingness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688031703/kf1akrckmvz7duopm5ec.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 482px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, one thing is clear: an individual&rsquo;s risk profile is not constant. It is not an exercise done once in a lifetime but a continuous process that needs to be revisited periodically. A financial risk profile can change over time due to various factors, such as personal circumstances, economic conditions, and market trends. Here are some ways that a financial risk profile can change</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Major life events</strong>, such as getting married, having children, changing jobs, or retiring, can significantly impact a person&rsquo;s financial situation and risk profile. For example, having children may increase expenses and decrease disposable income, while retiring may reduce income and increase the need for savings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Economic conditions</strong>, such as changes in interest rates, inflation, and unemployment, can affect a person&rsquo;s financial situation and risk profile. For example, a rise in inflation may reduce the value of savings. In contrast, decreasing interest rates may reduce the return on investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Market trends</strong>, such as changes in stock prices and real estate values, can affect a person&rsquo;s financial situation and risk profile. For example, a drop in stock prices may reduce the value of investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Changes in personal circumstances</strong>, such as health, employment, and income, can affect a person&rsquo;s financial situation and risk profile. For example, a sudden illness may increase medical expenses and reduce income. In contrast, a job loss may reduce income and increase the need for savings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As a person&rsquo;s financial goals and priorities change over time, their financial risk profile may also vary. For example, a person may adjust their investment strategy to reflect a shift in their financial goals, such as saving for retirement or paying for a child&rsquo;s education. It&rsquo;s essential to regularly review and update a financial risk profile to reflect a person&rsquo;s financial situation and goals accurately.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2023, India proudly assumed the presidency of G20 and reflects the thought of universal brotherhood through &lsquo;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.&rsquo; Specifically, in the Indian setting, the family holds an important and special place. It can exist in various forms and sizes, with generations living together or a single parent looking after children. Ultimately it is about the people who consider themselves family and their love for one another, getting through the most disastrous and the best times. And this notion doesn&rsquo;t change whether you are staying in India or abroad, in a small town or a metro city.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In this setting, family financial risk profiling becomes very important. Family members cannot have separate lives. Partners (read husband and wife, conventionally), because both work and have an income, share the expenses, and thus they must discuss their finances. Many personal decisions are financial &ndash; When to have kids, buy a house, support parents or siblings, or whether to go on a vacation or save for the new car to be purchased. One can be a diligent saver and other relatively indulgent. Both are right in their perspective, but differences in the money value can escalate into arguments on overspending and saving too much. Such a situation is surprisingly common, affecting nearly 40% of all couples.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Involving all family members in the financial risk profiling process is essential. It helps ensure everyone is on the same page regarding their financial goals and strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This process considers the financial situation of all family members, providing a complete picture of the family&rsquo;s overall financial health. It allows a more comprehensive evaluation of the family&rsquo;s financial risks and needs. With improved communication and collaboration, families can make informed decisions about their financial future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family financial risk profiling considers the interdependent financial needs of family members, such as joint income, shared expenses, and support for dependents. It can help families identify potential financial risks and plan to address them effectively. One of the most significant benefits I associate with family financial risk profiling is its insights into previous generations&rsquo; financial habits and behaviors. This exercise offers immense learning that can help families avoid making similar mistakes and better plan their financial future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The initial process of combining finances can be time-consuming and complicated. Nevertheless, one can conquer their fears and achieve their goals together. The key is awareness, communication, financial planning, and managing risks effectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family financial risk profiling is a process that involves evaluating a family&rsquo;s financial situation to identify potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks. One can apply the basic principles of risk profiling to a family setting. Start by gathering information about the financial situation of all family members, including income, expenses, debts, assets, and investments. It is also essential to consider factors such as employment status, health, and life expectancy. This information can then be used to evaluate the family&rsquo;s current financial situation, identify strengths and weaknesses, and look for potential risks, such as high debt levels or a lack of savings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The next important step is to work with family members to identify their financial goals and priorities, such as retirement planning, education expenses, and major purchases. Based on this information, one can formulate a financial plan, including developing a budget, reducing debt, increasing savings, and investing in specific financial products. As in the case of an individual, it is essential to regularly review and update the family&rsquo;s financial risk profile to ensure that it accurately reflects the family&rsquo;s financial situation. It primarily involves updating information, reevaluating goals and priorities, and making planned changes. Notably, tax implications are to be assessed individually.

It involves using digital technologies like big data analytics, cloud computing, mobile devices, and artificial intelligence (AI) to create new business models, goods, and services, as well as to streamline processes and increase productivity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Typically, DX involves a mix of adjustments to an organization&rsquo;s technology, procedures, and culture. This could mean automating manual tasks, turning paper-based processes into digital ones, giving customers new digital platforms, and using data analytics to help make informed decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The digital transformation, however, is lagging in some businesses. It has taken a while for the family office industry, which manages the assets of ultra-high net worth (UHNW) families globally, to catch up with technological advancement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over the past few decades, the number of wealthy people and families has grown a lot, as has their net worth. In 2022, there were 735 billionaires living in the United States. According to the most recent report from Oxfam India, India had 166 billionaires in 2022, up from 102 in 2020. Asia still has the most billionaires of any place in the world, accounting for 36% of all billionaires worldwide in 2021, as per Knight Frank&rsquo;s The Wealth Report 2022. India came in third place in terms of the number of billionaires in 2021, behind only China and the United States.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are about 17,000 family offices in the world, and 300 of them are in India. These numbers are expected to keep growing. The number of UHNW families is rapidly increasing, which has led to a booming family office sector. Ultra-wealthy families are setting up or using family offices to keep track of the growth, preservation, and transfer of wealth to future generations, as well as to handle a wide range of services, such as property and wealth management, private charity, estate and tax planning, legal matters, and more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The intricate and enigmatic nature of family offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even though they handle trillions of dollars in wealth, most family offices don&rsquo;t have the advanced technology systems and efficient business processes that are common in many other fields. Too often, family offices rely on manual work processes and strange, old tools to handle the complicated business of clients. Siloed systems frequently carry out tasks like general ledger and partnership accounting, managing and tracking the performance of investments, tax reporting, keeping track of capital commitments, and making bill payments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The complexity of family offices makes the situation worse. The family&rsquo;s financial affairs are typically characterized by an intricate web of interdependencies, which include numerous multi-entity and multigenerational family frameworks as well as distributed assets, debts, accounts, limited liability companies, partnerships, and other legal entities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To keep track of everything, office staff must enter duplicate data into numerous systems. This data must then be accommodated and consolidated using spreadsheets for reporting and analysis. Reporting delays, possible data errors, overworked high-value office staff who should be giving clients advice and counsel, and dissatisfied family members who feel there isn&rsquo;t enough transparency into their office operations and wealth management are all outcomes of these inefficiencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Just like in any other organization, operational effectiveness, agility, risk management, and decision-making are all hampered without trustworthy and timely insights. The fact that the data is private and only accessible to those with valid reasons only makes these problems worse.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Three methods for utilizing digital technology</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Using digital tools like Microsoft Excel is the first option. This may be sufficient for some. But for the majority, this is crude and requires a lot of manual labor. The innovative, advanced solutions come in second. These consist of specialized software for general ledger, customer relationship management, document management, and other purposes. These technological developments have transformed the family office industry and increased productivity significantly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although these methods are excellent at their functions, their lack of connectivity is a problem when data analytics, deep insight, and security are crucial. The third choice is to use an integrated framework that works with enterprise resource planning (ERP).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The ERP Approach</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every business has benefited from ERP systems&rsquo; increased productivity, adaptability, and insight. ERP software integrates various business data and processes into a unified system for better reporting, analysis, and operations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ERP systems integrate various discrete but interconnected services, such as finance, wealth management, human resources, customer services, and others, to enable family offices to carry out specific tasks and business processes. To manage and keep track of crucial business data, all of these interact with a single data store.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Without a doubt, developing a unified ERP platform for managing family wealth and business affairs presents unique challenges. A unified platform probably won&rsquo;t have all the decorative additional features that an advanced solution would. To handle the complicated ways that family members and legal entities share ownership, it also needs a flexible data model.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For this kind of unification of business operations and stakeholders to work, everything in the family office needs to fit together smoothly, which is a hard job. Even though it doesn&rsquo;t have all the decorative additional features and has a simple data model, once a family office has a truly unified ERP system in place, it will be ready to reach new heights of value creation, efficiency, and openness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In order to adapt to shifting market conditions and maintain their competitiveness in a world that is becoming more and more digital, many organizations across a variety of industries now consider digital transformation to be a top strategic priority. Instead of having to wait for weeks to assess their net worth, DX in the family office enables each family member to receive personalized insights as frequently as every day. The family office has much more operational leverage, which boosts output and profits. The office staff is given the freedom to focus on the future rather than constantly reflecting on the past. They can spend more time planning and implementing strategies to protect and increase family wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The financial and business affairs of UHNW families are becoming more complex as a result of the growing globalization of resources and the introduction of new investment vehicles and strategies. To stay competitive, family offices must embrace digital transformation. To do this, they should start by evaluating their digital technologies and software to make sure that they are transparent, accurate in their data, efficient, secure, and appropriate for the needs of the family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687778678/fdpfbpqwmr9wbxzahqip.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How does DX benefit family offices?","seo_keywords":"How does DX benefit family offices?","seo_description":"Digital transformation, or DX, is the process of using digital technology to fundamentally alter how businesses operate, serve their clients, and engage in competitive business activities.

Remember that you have to spend more money to get higher quality products and services.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There may be limitations on their financial solutions as they recommend only the ones they know will generate the most returns for you.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">They offer fewer financial products or services as they don&rsquo;t get any commission to sell financial products like insurance, mutual funds, or securities.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Fee Charging Methods of Fee-Only Financial Planners</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fee-only financial planners charge fees in various ways. The primary method is to charge their clients a percentage of the assets they manage. The management fee varies with financial planners. Usually, they charge anywhere between 0.20% and 2% of the total AUM. This percentage fee is withdrawn from your account quarterly, half-yearly, or annually.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some fee-only financial planners charge a fee in another way: an hourly or monthly fee. This fee method benefits you as you pay only for what you get. Remember that they won&rsquo;t charge you for a quick phone call for some financial advice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although fee-only financial planners may use various fee methods, the exact cost of the service depends on the specific services you want. More experienced financial advisors work only with High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs), and they are more likely to charge higher fees than novice financial advisors at smaller wealth management firms. The fee ranges vary greatly, so before you choose a fee-only financial planner, make sure you understand their charges and whether they match your needs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Who are Fee-Based Advisors?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You could work with another type of financial professional known as fee-based financial planners. The title may seem similar to fee-only financial planners, but there is a big difference between the two.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You have to pay a fee to the fee-based financial planners. On top of that, they receive commissions from financial and investment products they sell you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conflicts of interest may not arise while working with fee-only financial planners. But it may happen when you work with fee-based advisors. This is mainly because of the commissions they earn by recommending financial products, even if they are not suited for their client. However, usually, fee-based advisors follow the &lsquo;suitability rule.&rsquo; That means they recommend financial and investment products that fit their client&rsquo;s financial goals and plans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Finding the Right Fee-Only Financial Planner</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Whether it is a fee-based or fee-only financial planner, you must develop a cordial relationship and trust them as they are an essential part of your life. But, more than that, finding certified and experienced fee-only financial planners or advisors is difficult.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">No need to worry. We have listed several ways to find a trustworthy fee-only financial planner who is a perfect fit for you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;If you are a person who trusts your friends, family, and colleagues,&nbsp; you can start your search for the right fee-only financial planner with them. If you trust those people, you will likely trust the people they recommend. Keep in mind that only those interested in finance and financial planning can help you.</span><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;You can search for certified financial advisors in your area on&nbsp; &nbsp;online platforms. These platforms also help you filter financial professionals based on your specific needs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;In India, you can find Securities and Exchange Board of India&nbsp; &nbsp;(SEBI) approved financial advisors from the directories of the Association of Registered Investment Advisers (ARIA) or SEBI. These platforms ensure that the fee-only advisor is certified, approved, and experienced that suit your needs.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is not the end. After you have picked a few potential fee-only financial planners from these platforms, you must do thorough research on them. You can read online reviews on them or check for their background information. All these will help you narrow down the list of financial advisors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Then, you can schedule meetings with these short-listed financial advisors to briefly discuss your economic conditions and investment plans. This process helps you better understand what they would offer you and how you will work with them. As the final step, you can finalize one financial planner you want, sign a contract and begin working with them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687777787/l2aglrmdeyhov2v5bjac.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"‘Fee-Only’ Financial Planners – Who are they?","seo_keywords":"‘Fee-Only’ Financial Planners – Who are they?","seo_description":"The title, fee-only financial planner, speaks for itself.

Social return is a way to measure the broader, non-financial benefits of an investment, like how it affects health, education, or the environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, an investment in renewable energy sources may give the investor a direct financial return. It may also reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality, which is good for the environment and public health. This positive effect can be thought of as part of the investment&rsquo;s social return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As people pay more attention to how investments affect people and the environment, the idea of social return is becoming more important. It is used to figure out how well social investments, like those made by governments or foundations, work and how businesses affect society and the environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, investment return, also called return on investment (ROI), is a measure of how well an investment works or how profitable it is. It can also be used to compare the performance of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure how much revenue an investment generates in relation to how much it costs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Then, what is impact investing?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Impact investing is a new-age investment strategy with the goal of improving society and the environment while making a profit. It entails putting money into businesses, non-profits, and funds that are trying to address issues including poverty, climate change, and poor healthcare and education. The objective is to help people and the planet while providing a financial return to investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Forget philanthropy. Embrace impact investing to generate both an ROI and a social return from a single investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>How does impact investing work?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Impact investing works by investing money and entrepreneurial talent into groups, projects, and initiatives that are trying to make a positive impact in society or the environment. This can be done in different ways, such as by investing in companies that offer affordable housing, clean energy, or sustainable agriculture, or in funds that give money to microfinance institutions that help people with low incomes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The first step is to find opportunities for impact investments. There are many ways to do this, such as through impact investment firms, online platforms, or direct contact with companies and organizations. Then, investors look at the opportunities from both a financial and an impact perspective and decide whether or not to invest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Once the money is invested, the impact investor keeps a close eye on it to make sure that both the financial and social goals are being met. The investor may also give the investee organisation extra help, like technical assistance or mentorship, to help it reach its impact goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Impact investing has a deep impact on several sectors. Some of them are listed below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial Inclusion: Impact investing enables easier access to affordable credit for the masses.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Affordable Housing: Impact investing creates more residential assets, addressing the housing shortage.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Education: Impact investing can give less fortunate people access to low-cost education and training to improve their skills.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Agriculture: It can increase the quality of farming and agricultural productivity while ensuring enhanced traceability and better livelihoods for farmers.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Clean Energy: Impact investing promotes lower dependency on fossil fuels and democratises access to electricity. It can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Healthcare: It can offer lower incidences of incurable diseases and access to low-cost healthcare.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>India and Impact Investment</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India has turned into a global hub for impact investing. In the last ten years, the ecosystem for impact investing has grown quickly in the country. As per the latest information from the Impact Investors Council (IIC), over 600 impact investing ventures in India now have a positive impact on more than 500 million lives and have pooled more than $9 billion. Most capital for impact investing, though, comes from international investors and donors, such as global foundations, institutional investors, finance institutions, and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs). This influx of capital for impact investing has helped develop a solid impact investing ecosystem, but it also serves as a reminder that most private capital in the country is still getting invested through traditional investment approaches.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made social impact investments (SII) under the Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) Regulations of 2012. This was done to encourage impact investing in India. The regulator must grant SIIs more benefits if they want to attract SIIs. SIIs are still considered Category-I AIFs and get the same benefits as other venture capital funds, small and medium enterprises (SME) funds, infrastructure funds, special situation funds, and other funds. SIIs don&rsquo;t get any extra incentives, tax breaks, or relaxations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, you can find a number of impact investing startups like Saarthi.ai, Milaap, and WeNaturalists.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the table below, you can see a list of the key players in impact investing in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687779638/hvoa39rrmmv8hzhezadx.jpg\" style=\"width: 916px; height: 270px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As investors, social entrepreneurs, and citizens, we have a moral obligation to solve the problems that our planet and its inhabitants are facing.

So, it&rsquo;s not surprising that multigenerational family businesses have their own kind of conflict. Conflicts happen when people have different ideas, and these differences can be made worse by gaps between generations and cultures. Conflict leads to mistrust and tension, which in turn make it hard for people to talk to each other.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, how can multigenerational family businesses deal with disagreements and bring unity, especially when passing leadership and responsibility from one generation to the next? Once a conflict is recognized, it&rsquo;s important to learn how to build trust, reframe problems, and build a good structure with rules and tools to help.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A new generation brings new ideas and energy, as well as different ways of thinking about risk and how the company should change. This can cause conflict in the company. But most family businesses are set up to avoid conflict instead of dealing with it head-on. So, the company acts as if everything is fine, but it doesn&rsquo;t realize that some conflict is normal and necessary for a successful family business and that there is a middle ground to be found. Sometimes disagreements are ignored, sometimes they come out as personal conflict, and sometimes they are just hard to talk about.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The first step is to figure out how to recognize and talk about the conflicts, as well as why people don&rsquo;t bring up tough issues and instead try to avoid deep conversations. There are some questions that can help with this, such as:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What&rsquo;s stopping me from bringing up my problem?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">People often don&rsquo;t ask questions or dig deeper into problems because they are afraid of making things worse or because they don&rsquo;t want to hurt other people&rsquo;s feelings. Understanding these feelings will help you frame the problems and figure out what the conflict is really about. It will take you beyond what you can see on the surface and get you closer to the root of the problem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Can I change how I feel about conflict?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Accepting that conflict is a dynamic process and being willing to stand up for what you believe and want to stand for requires being brave, saying what you don&rsquo;t like about the status quo, and being open to the results. This is better than having a &ldquo;win or lose&rdquo; mentality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How can I break down a bigger question into smaller ones that I can share?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Just writing down a problem in a different way, if possible, with the people who are involved in the conflict is enough to help figure out who else is involved, what has been done so far and why it isn&rsquo;t working, and what the real goal is.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When talking about a conflict, if you ask these questions and think about the worst possible outcome, the problem seems smaller because you feel more capable of dealing with whatever happens. The bigger picture is clearer and helps people understand each other, which is the first step to building trust.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Establishing Trust</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">How can trust be built or even just put back together after it has been hurt? The first step is to recognize and learn to understand that everyone is different and has different needs at different times. Simple actions can build trust, like keeping promises and doing what was agreed to. Empathy maps&nbsp;(a visualization tool) can help you connect with other family members and talk about things that are getting in the way. Most of the time, people don&rsquo;t mean to hurt others, and an apology can go a long way towards rebuilding trust. When trust has been broken, it can&rsquo;t be fixed all at once; it has to be earned and grown step by step.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Other small things you can do to build trust include finding peers in your family business and freely sharing what you know with them. You can also try to figure out how they learn and how you can convey what you have learned to them in a meaningful way. You can also work together with new experts and new ideas, creating shared frameworks and experiences.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Finding common ground and working on new projects together, instead of pointing out differences, can help build a bridge between building trust and finding new ways to look at problems. Shared interests don&rsquo;t have to be related to work all the time. They could be things like sports, other hobbies, or family dinners that everyone takes part in. These common interests build trust and make it easier to get along with people of all ages, which can help in the boardroom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For instance, the new generation may want to take the company public, while the previous generation may oppose this, but when the conflict is articulated, both generations want the company to survive and succeed. This common goal during conflict helps the business overcome obstacles and reduce friction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Reframing Problems</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tradition can be used as a link when reframing problems. On the surface, adding an e-commerce platform to a business may seem new and scary, causing tension and conflict. However, if the change is seen as part of the company&rsquo;s long-standing tradition of innovation, both the old and the young can support it, tying the new to the old. Tradition isn&rsquo;t just a tie to the past; it&rsquo;s also a foundation for the future, and the next generation can do the best job of promoting it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Building organizational structures</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The last step in managing conflicts is to set up the organizational structures, rules, and tools that will support and make possible the needed changes in behavior. Changing the rules and structures of an organization can cause conflict on its own, and technology can make it worse. This is why it is important to handle it carefully. Not only has the pandemic compelled all kinds of businesses to communicate with each other in a time of crisis, but it has also pushed them to use technology to communicate digitally in a time of great uncertainty. But many companies didn&rsquo;t necessarily choose to use technology to handle communications when they were in conflict. However, being pressured to speed up the use of technology has led to many process changes that help companies handle communications when they are in conflict.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Using technology to resolve conflicts</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Multigenerational, geographically dispersed family businesses can now communicate using technology. The need to use technology initially revealed which family members were most involved in the business. The more active family members were given a platform to share weekly or biweekly updates, even if they were only a few lines long, on what decisions had been made and how they shaped their relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The use of technology aided family businesses in holding shareholder meetings. Virtual &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; for different types of participation, tracking for document sharing and signing, and teams with rules of engagement were established.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Technology is just a tool, not a conflict resolution solution, but the speed, scalability, and usability of a well-designed and implemented technology platform have helped organizations implement hard-to-implement behavioural changes. Transparency from technology strengthens trust through small actions. It also fosters family trust and increases family business involvement.

It started with one day &ndash; February 14, celebrated as Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and now an entire week dedicated to love.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The exchange of cards, flowers, and gifts between loved ones is a way to show that they care about each other, making everyone happy. In the process, the memories created together are priceless.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">That said, how would you feel if I were to tell you that gift-giving results in a&nbsp;<em>deadweight loss</em>?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Deadweight loss of gifting refers to the reduction in economic welfare or surplus due to transferring goods or resources as gifts rather than through market transactions. It implies that the recipients valued the gifts less than someone paid for them, a concept proposed by Joel Waldfogel, an economics professor at Yale, then in a 1993 paper. He stated the estimated gift-giving loss is between $4 billion and $13 billion. The most conservative estimate suggests that the receiver valued the gift at 90 percent of the buying price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Probably, it is this notion of the deadweight loss associated with gift-giving which gave rise to gift cards &ndash;a substitute for cash.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Before you make up your mind not to give gifts this valentine, let me highlight that the study focused on ill-chosen gifts. Economically speaking, gift-giving can be a waste of money if you don&rsquo;t know someone well. But there are forces other than economics in this world. The respondents were happiest with gifts from friends and significant others who have a good idea of what they like. Gifts serve many functions, such as signaling regard and demonstrating social ties with the recipient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, maybe this can be a year for you to do something different. Starting this year, use the celebration of love as an opportunity to give a gift that will provide value for years to come and strengthen your relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing in your loved ones can be a way to show your care and support for their long-term financial well-being. Unlike gifts, investments have the potential to appreciate over time and can support your future financial goals as a couple. Additionally, investing can also be a way to demonstrate your commitment to your partner and your shared financial future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Here are a few reasons why investing might be a better option than giving gifts:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Long-term benefits: Investing provides an opportunity to build wealth over time and potentially provide a source of income in the future.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Personalization: Investing allows you to tailor your support to your loved one&rsquo;s specific financial goals and needs.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thoughtful gesture: Investing shows that you are not just thinking about your loved one in the present but also considering their future financial security.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Lasting impact: Unlike gifts, which may be enjoyed at the moment but eventually lose value, investment can grow and provide benefits for years to come.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Of course, everyone&rsquo;s situation is different, and It&rsquo;s essential to consider your own financial goals and your loved one&rsquo;s financial needs and preferences before making any investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do remember, getting your finances&nbsp;in order involves more than just investments.

Use a &ldquo;yours, mine, and ours&rdquo; approach based on the relationship. Shift more towards the &ldquo;ours&rdquo; bucket, developing a cohesive financial plan that best meets the needs of both parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>I hope some of the below-mentioned suggestions form a part of the bouquet of gifts for your loved one. &nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Building wealth in the long run by investing in equities through monthly SIP in mutual funds</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Buying insurance policies to provide them with much-needed financial support in case of any illness or death</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Buying them a gold asset as a store of value and hedging against market forces.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Invest in their future by giving a cash gift that can be used to start a new business or study.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Increasing and improving financial literacy is one of the best gifts one could give their partner.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Don&rsquo;t forget to complement it with a nice home-cooked meal, a candlelit dinner, and chocolates will be the icing on the cake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember, there are a million different ways to express love.

This gives us a great chance to do some digital introspection. Each family office is right at the edge of this chance. So, here are six tips to help you take advantage of digital collaborative technology and automation tools to do well this year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Remote collaboration</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We&rsquo;ve all had difficult times in the last two years. The COVID-19 has put the strength and commitment of family offices to the test. Family offices have been shown to be strong and flexible. They used technology for communication and decision-making so that their work could keep moving forward. The majority of families have had a good experience. Prior to the pandemic, a greater part of family office management was done at a few meetings (usually four times a year) that were set up in advance. With the rise of virtual collaboration, there is more asynchronous work happening to keep family and stakeholder management projects moving forward. Family office staff and family members who are helping with these projects are getting together more often, but from a distance, for brief meetings and later working on assignments individually.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family offices with planned family and stakeholder management frameworks and processes will have to hold important meetings in person, where they make crucial decisions. But asynchronous collaboration will happen, and it is a key factor that pushes family office staff and family members. It will save time and money by making it easier to get work done. The cost of meetings will go down as families choose to have high-impact meetings in person less often and work together more virtually between in-person meetings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Centralization of Critical Information</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since we are all more used to working from home, we think that in 2022, more time and money will be invested into making sure that family and stakeholder information is all in one place.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since fewer people will be attending meetings in person, all the data that used to be stored and frequently updated in a single location like an office will be available online.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, a family office can invest in a digital &ldquo;data room&rdquo; to store family and stakeholder documents, policies, and personal data of family members. Different family members with different roles can explore this data storage framework as per their needs. This way of centralising family and stakeholder information has made the family office feel more open and transparent. Family members are well informed and equipped to make faster decisions as they have easier access to the documents they need to read and give feedback on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Ford Motor Company, which is owned by a family, says that its intranet is the reason it has become a digital business. Ford&rsquo;s modern communications hub was created in 1996 as a personal online space for employees. Since then, it has become a key part of the company&rsquo;s plan for all stakeholders to share information better and more efficiently.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. The Enhancement of Data Security</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From what we have seen, most families aren&rsquo;t very good at using computers to keep track of family and stakeholder information. Many family offices don&rsquo;t have clear and well-established policies for cybersecurity, so family and stakeholder information is managed in a haphazard fashion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As virtual collaboration and asynchronous work grow, family offices will spend money on cybersecurity and highly secured data management systems to protect their data in the best way possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Increasing Participation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In family offices, the way a decision is made is often just as important as the decision itself. For long-term success and peace among stakeholders, you need a method for making decisions. When making decisions, it can be hard to find a good balance between being objective and making rapid decisions. This is especially true when dealing with uncertainty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Automation tools and technology not only make it easier to do complex tasks, but they can also be used to make sure that a family office&rsquo;s shareholders always have the most up-to-date information they need to understand and take part in making important decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are powerful digital automation tools that update, record, and report key metrics for family offices that need to communicate with a number of active and inactive family members. From filling out tax forms in finance to streamlining workflows in Human Resources (HR) and customer service, automated processes can save family offices a great deal of time, make it easier to analyse data, and help them make good decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Enabling Education</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you don&rsquo;t teach your family members the basics of business, it can lead to misunderstandings, bad decisions, and fights within the family. It is important for family members to understand the financial and business concepts that show how their organisation has done in the past, how healthy it is now, and how much it could grow in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A cloud-based data repository is a good way for family offices to help family members understand these frameworks and make better business decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">By putting all the information in one place, family shareholders can look at past and present information to figure out how well their business is doing and what its potential is. Family offices can use digital tools to share information with directors, shareholders, and family members. This can help avoid misunderstandings, bad decisions, and possible fights that can happen when different people act on different data.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. Promoting Accountability</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Usually, the roles of the individuals in a family office become clear along with the growth of the business and the family. Having separate boards and committees makes it easier for people to share information and gives everyone a say in how decisions are made.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Digital tracking tools provide a cheap and real-time way for business owners, stakeholders, bankers, lawyers, and managers who work for family offices to collaborate together.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Whether it&rsquo;s a single or multifamily office, there are now a lot of digital tools that help family office members stay accountable and take part in making crucial decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Bottom Line&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The pandemic has been a very important reminder of what family offices can do, especially with the help of technology. In the past two years, digitalization has helped many businesses quickly change the way they operate. This has shown many family offices how important it is to keep investing in their Information Technology (IT) infrastructure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our message is simple: this is the turning point, and now is the time to act. Digitalized governance will become more common, and family offices that have already built up their digital capabilities will probably do better than those that are trying to catch up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687782947/yvllldq6eh6upajppjtn.png","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How Does Technology Transform the Way Family Offices Work?","seo_keywords":"How Does Technology Transform the Way Family Offices Work?","seo_description":"As we move into the third year of the Corona pandemic, several significant changes have happened in the wealth management ecosystem, particularly among family offices.

The Modi government will seek a third term next year in the Lok Sabha elections in 2024 (nine States will be going to polls this year). Presently, enough information is floating in the market on Google, Twitter, memes, etc. I intend to look at the implications we can draw for our financial planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Union Budget of India 2023, presented amidst the commodity price spikes and aggressively developed market rate hikes, gives the term &lsquo;Saptrishi&rsquo; depicting its seven priorities &ndash;&nbsp; Inclusive development; Reaching the last mile; Infra &amp; investment; Unleashing the potential; Green growth; Youth power, and Financial sector.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Before discussing the implications, let&rsquo;s understand what a government budget is. It is a financial plan for a fiscal year that outlines the government&rsquo;s expected revenue and expenditures. It is a tool used by the government to allocate resources and prioritize spending, including investments in infrastructure, public services, and social programs. The budget also provides a picture of the government&rsquo;s financial position and the impact of its spending and revenue policies on the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The budget announcements impact different components of financial planning &ndash; from tax planning to insurance planning, retirement planning, and investment planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s start with the most talked about in any Budget &ndash; taxation changes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From the<strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">tax planning</span>&nbsp;</strong>perspective,&nbsp;there is a clear indication that the government wants the taxpayers to shift to the new regime. They have made it a default setting (intending to take benefit of the inertia in financial decision-making). Moreover, there are several changes announced in the new regime &ndash; reduction of tax slabs from 6 to 5; introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and family pension; increase in the rebate upto 7 lakhs (note that it&rsquo;s not the same as basic exemption limit); limit for presumptive taxes for businessman and professionals; Surcharge for income above ₹5Cr reduced from 37% to 25%; reduction in the maximum rate (for those with income more than ₹5 crores) from about 42.7% to about 39%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The default new tax regime and revised tax slabs will result in higher disposable income, helping in better savings and additional spending. Since the deductions are not available under the new tax regime, there is a possibility that the savings rate will be reduced (ignoring life and health insurance). &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687783079/jl8tiwejgyi7phicvtgm.png\" style=\"height: 718px; width: 800px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Furthermore, the treatment of capital gains has been modified. Firstly, converting physical Gold to e-gold is not considered capital gains, incentivizing the gold monetization scheme. The second relates to the capital gains arising from stocks, gold, real estate, or even startups that could be invested in a residential place (to promote the housing sector). The budget proposes to cap these deductions under sections 54 and 54F to Rs 10 crore, effective from the assessment year 2024-25.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Additionally, for women investors, Mahila Samman Savings Schemes investments can be made with no TDS till ₹2 Lakh with 7.5% for two years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Considering the<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">&nbsp;<strong>insurance planning</strong>,&nbsp;</span>one of the critical budget proposals is to tax the proceeds from life insurance premiums over the annual premium of ₹5 lakhs from the new financial year, i.e., from April 1, 2023 (Not applicable to ULIP and the Death benefit). It&rsquo;s not surprising to see insurance stocks going south by more than 10%. Notably, the exemption under section 10 (10D) has been removed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">retirement planning,</span>&nbsp;</strong>the limit for Senior Savings Schemes has been hiked to ₹30 Lakhs now from the old ₹15 Lakh. The scheme earns 8% currently (when inflation is @5.7%). That means a senior couple can park Rs. 60 lakhs and earn a pre-tax interest of Rs. 4.8 lakh (if that&rsquo;s all they make, it&rsquo;s entirely non-taxable). That&rsquo;s Rs. 40,000 per month, which is pretty decent for a person to live on, and there are hardly any other &ldquo;safe&rdquo; avenues at this interest rate. If you&rsquo;re planning for your parents or retiring soon, this might be a way to park money (for five years) to get a decent return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Considering&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>investment planning</strong>,</span>&nbsp;we may look out for the sectors&ndash; technology (Going digital), Energy (Go Green), Infrastraticure, and Tourism, thrust areas of the budget.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>On a side note, the word green was mentioned over 20 times, at least during the 1.5-hour speech.&nbsp;</em>Thirty-five thousand crore funds are allocated for priority capital investment for net zero.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The best part of the budget speech was the recognition of changing socio-economic paradigm in adopting technology and digitalizing routine life. Increased attention to initiatives like simplified KYC, Digi locker for businesses, integrated IT portal, and National Data Governance Policy will help startups focus on building great products.&nbsp;Such an expansion of the digital infrastructure could benefit technology companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The tourism sector has received a healthy boost in the budget, with &ldquo;Dekho Apna Desh&rdquo; getting a well-deserved spotlight. Under this, 50 tourist destinations will be selected on a mission mode to be developed as a package for domestic and international tourism. Increased infrastructure and rural development allocation could benefit companies operating in these sectors. Moreover, with the higher disposable income due to changes in the taxation rules, the auto sector and consumer durables space would benefit. However, the actual impact on stock market investments will depend on various factors, including the global economic scenario, geopolitical developments, and company-specific factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From July 1 this year, one would have to spend 20% more for money spent abroad, including traveling and spending abroad, buying US stocks, or any form of remittance (Liberalised Remittance Scheme &ndash; LRS). Also, from April 1, 2023, any income received from a REIT or InvIT is fully taxable in the hands of unit holders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Market-linked debentures (MLDs), structured products that invest in fixed-income and derivative instruments with a minimum investment amount of ₹10 lakhs, gained traction in the last many years as they were offering tax arbitrage. Till now, Listed MLDs were taxed 10% after a one-year holding period, similar to equity. In the Budget 2023, the finance minister proposed that these securities&rsquo; sale, redemption, or maturity will be treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at the applicable individual slab rates (with no indexation). As this has an immediate impact, one should sell market-linked debenture quickly to avail of the tax benefit.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Limit on Post office Monthly Income Scheme is increased from ₹4.5 lac to ₹9 lac for individuals and 15 lac for joint holdings</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do remember the Budget proposals may change or differ when the budget is passed by the Parliament and notified by the government. Consider a long-term investment approach and do not make decisions based solely on budget announcements.

Inflation and technological disruptions will largely influence the overall trend of the global family office business in 2023. They will determine how family offices think, invest, and operate worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Challenges and threats always accompany these trends. A family office can only position and prepare the organization accordingly to mitigate the risk and ensure a smoother operation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article discusses the top nine trends in family office business in 2023.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Investment Strategies to Beat Inflation</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During soaring inflation, holding on to cash or fixed cash flow-generating assets will not preserve wealth or generate returns. So, family offices can reconsider Strategic Asset Allocations or SAAs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A diversified portfolio with a mixture of assets such as equities, gold, and realty is a long-term hedge against inflation. In addition, family offices can generate returns with the catalysts of inflation outside of their core portfolio. For example, they can invest in automation development or quality companies with solid fundamentals. Health care, green technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and private markets are other growth-oriented investment arenas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Processing Automation</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Processing of statements, particularly in private equities, is a manual yet repetitive process. Moreover, as family offices increase their investments in private equities, they must process more monthly statements. Automation helps to streamline the processing of reports for family offices. It also enables them and their clients to save a great deal of time and resources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Hybrid Work Culture</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Hybrid work culture is the new normal in the post-pandemic world. In this era of quiet quitting, moonlighting, and great resignation, a flexible work schedule is no longer a unique enterprise trait but an industry norm. Although frequent direct interpersonal communication is still essential in the family office, occasional direct meetings will also get the job done.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Growing Interest and Scepticism in Cryptocurrency</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The recent collapse of FTX raises skepticism over the future of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Although most family offices have shown interest in digital assets, only a few have invested in cryptocurrency. Since wealth preservation is family offices&rsquo; primary objective, investing in digital assets would be a considerable risk for family offices today.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>ESG and Sustainable Investing</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family offices have a more significant role to play in tackling environmental issues. As the younger generation&rsquo;s influence grows in the family office with the retirement of the older generations, their stake in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and sustainable investing also grows. Compared to traditional investment practices, this transition can create steady returns over the long term.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Ever-Changing Relationship with Technology</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Technological advancements certainly benefit family offices, whether it&rsquo;s by using it or investing in it. For example, CoVID-induced lockdowns created a remote working culture hinging on cloud-based virtual meeting applications and collaborative platforms. It also helped them to manage all their data and reports in one place. On the other hand, family offices generated greater returns by investing in the technology sector through Initial Public Offering (IPO), venture capital, and private equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the utilization of technology comes data privacy concerns, mental health issues, and the spread of fake information. Therefore, an efficient family office must use the best of both sides of the technology world.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cybersecurity Concerns</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Barrons states cybersecurity is the number one concern for family offices worldwide. Their study surveyed 78 family offices, and 96% of the respondents were victims of cybersecurity attacks. In addition, a 2017 survey conducted by Campden says that 32% of family offices have suffered heavy losses in cyberattacks, and nearly half did not have a cybersecurity plan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the main reasons cited for the cybersecurity menace is the lesser regulation on family offices than traditional wealth management firms. Another reason is the slow pace of technological adoption in the private wealth industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Undoubtedly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the most enormous disruptive force in every business worldwide, including the family office. If we can fully utilize the capabilities of AI, it can perform tasks at greater efficiency and speed than humans ever thought possible. So, AI can free up humans from monotonous tasks and let them focus on higher value-creating activities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Like AI, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) saves money managers from tedious tasks and helps them create more value. For example, RPA can do repetitive tasks like data entry, gathering tax information, form filling, and account reconciliations. In addition, combining RPA with AI and Machine Learning (ML) creates greater efficiencies in business operations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>The Future is Bright for Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The current investment environment demands transformation in investment strategies, leveraging technology, social awareness, and outsourcing. Also, direct investing and impact investing have become inevitable these days. Succession planning issues are mounting, and operational costs are rising. Proper planning and execution are needed to mitigate these risks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite all these challenges, the family office remains a viable option and desirable way for ultra-wealthy families to preserve and grow wealth for generations to come. However, the future is bright for family offices only if they innovate rather than go ahead embracing traditions and legacy systems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cloud-based solutions have no restrictions and let investment firms manage sensitive data in one place. They also allow faster yet accessible communication among staff and family members. Real-time data updates have become another advantage of cloud technology. It brings down Turnaround Time (TAT) and enhances reporting accuracy, providing family offices with the information they need to make faster yet better investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the upcoming years, only the firms that have transformed into digital leaders in their industry will have faster revenue growth and higher productivity than their peers who have yet to embrace digitization. Fortunately, the higher costs and complexity associated with technology have been eliminated by affordable yet easier-to-implement Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687783460/laddrcvxmcjordcx8viy.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Top Nine Family Office Trends to Watch in 2023","seo_keywords":"Top Nine Family Office Trends to Watch in 2023","seo_description":"Setting up a family office is a great way to manage, grow and eventually distribute family wealth to successive generations.

However, the budget could raise this limit to ₹50,000. It can incentivize policyholders to secure higher coverage against costly hospital bills. Thus, promising peace of mind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Boosted NPS Contribution with Section 80CCD (1B)</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The newly added subsection 1B of Section 80 CCD provides an extra ₹50,000 deduction for individual taxpayers who contribute to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Tier I accounts. This limit could be increased to ₹100,000, promoting more significant long-term savings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Enhanced Savings Under Section 80C</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The popular Section 80C enables taxpayers to lower their taxable income through tax-saving investments, with the highest annual deduction being ₹1.5 lakhs.

In addition, you must be able to identify competitive advantages and asymmetrical risk margins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Play It Like Chess</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The game of chess demands in-depth thinking, strategizing, and deep work from each player.

Similarly, we prefer to live a life that is not so hard yet not so easy. Being at both ends of the spectrum of business and life is not pleasant for everyone. So, we plan our life accordingly, and businessmen strategize their trades that fit every economic and climatic condition. For example, my uncle converts his shop into an ice cream or juice parlor in summer and trades blazers in winter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Like my uncle, I, too, had opted for dual specialization: A major in Finance and a minor in Marketing<em>.</em>&nbsp;I thought specialization in two fields would reduce the risk of not getting any job. Finally, I got a job in marketing financial products, which suited me well for a dual specialized postgraduate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, I ventured into long-term wealth creation by investing in asset classes like equity, debt, gold, alternative investments, realty, etc., for better diversification. Keep in mind that we can do intra-diversification within each asset class. For instance, there is a spread between commercial, residential, and plot in realty. In equity, there is a spread between Indian and US equity. There are also spreads in equity between small, mid, and large capitalization categories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I believe that returns are made in specific investments, but wealth is preserved in diversification. And I focus more on wealth preservation rather than minting higher returns. I also believe that investing in non-correlated asset classes can mitigate the risk. Therefore, my investment objective is to achieve positive inflation-adjusted return through investing in non-correlated asset classes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What does correlation mean?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In investment, correlation is the measurement of the degree to which prices of two securities or asset classes move in relation to each other. The correlation coefficient is the measurement scale of correlation. For example, +1 is the perfect positive correlation coefficient, implying that prices of two stocks or asset classes move (up or down) in the same direction. In the case of a negative correlation coefficient denoted by -1, the price of two securities or asset classes moves in the opposite direction. A zero correlation coefficient means no linear relationship between two variables.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The examples of these three correlation coefficient scenarios are given below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Large-cap mutual funds generally correlate positively to the Standard and Poor&rsquo;s 500 (S&amp;P 500) Index.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">US Dollar has zero correlation with Indian equity.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gold and Indian equities often move in opposite directions. So, they are negatively correlated.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, although we can achieve diversification by investing in various asset classes, how they correlate is also significant. This is because adding a negatively correlated asset class in a portfolio can considerably reduce the risk without compromising the expected return rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While creating a diversified yet non-correlated portfolio, we must put the effort in the right direction by knowing that correlation can change per various market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We also need to keep in mind these five points about non-correlated assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The perfect identification of negatively correlated asset classes is nearly impossible. For example, although gold and Indian equity are negatively correlated, there are times when their prices move in the same direction.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Portfolios with non-correlated assets are not guaranteed to give you high returns. More than enhancing returns, they reduce the investment risk without cutting it completely. Still, investments are prone to various risks.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">More than being non-correlated is needed for investing. It is also vital that asset classes should be growth-oriented, which gives positive returns in the long term. For example, cash has zero correlation with equity, and keeping the former in a portfolio is not advisable.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If an investor chases non-correlated investments, they may end up in riskier investment avenues like crypto assets.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Regular portfolio monitoring and rebalancing should be done.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are no extreme levels in a non-correlated portfolio. That means there wouldn&rsquo;t be extreme gains or losses, which can lead to more consistent returns. This is because gains in an investment give a cushion to the loss in another investment. Therefore, while creating a non-correlated portfolio, your advisor needs to gauge your risk tolerance, understand your long-term financial goals and develop diversification strategies accordingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Partner</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687786306/eaon6bquvktmxg6kcuii.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Non-Correlation: An Effective Diversification Tool","seo_keywords":"Non-Correlation: An Effective Diversification Tool","seo_description":"All of us would like to live in a climate that is not too cold or hot.

It is all about discovering better ways of doing business that will benefit corporations and citizens both now and in the future. This concept, though now in vogue, is a 100-year-old concept. In 1950, The Pioneer Group, US, became the first fund house to screen the so-called &ldquo;sin-stocks&rdquo; &ndash; tobacco, alcohol, and gambling from their portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, under Socially-responsible Investing, the underlying principle is to avoid investments in specific stocks or industries through negative screening according to defined ethical guidelines. Impact investing involves investing in projects or companies actively working to bring positive social or environmental change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ESG investing is becoming indispensable. The environmental factors in ESG refer to the company&rsquo;s toxic gas emission control measures, consumption of energies (renewable energies, to be specific), water and waste management, and other factors which can positively impact the environment. The Social factors include the well-being of the employees and the staff, society as a whole, and local communities. Finally, the governance factors refer to the ethical standards followed by the firms, their management involvement, transparency of financial data and tax information, board members and their diversity, and others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This year, we have seen the impact of heat waves in several European nations. We also witness incidents like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Volkswagen&rsquo;s breaching ecological norms, and Facebook&rsquo;s data privacy disclosure. These are signs of things to come if we refuse to act. Although we may have diverse solutions to these issues, businesses must at least adhere to some minimum standards. It is crucial for us, the planet, and future generations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687785170/sbhbnduad8prlncqdz6m.png\" style=\"width: 489px; height: 441px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">International investors with assets of $43 trillion have vowed to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios. According to a Bloomberg study, sustainable investing has gone mainstream, with an estimated $37.8 trillion in assets under management in FY2022. According to the same research, global ESG assets will exceed $53 trillion by FY2025. There has been an increase of 88% in investment in ESG funds globally, in which Europe made 80% of the contribution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Benori report states that sustainable investments account for one-third of assets under management (AUM) in the United States and 36% globally. However, the Indian sustainable investment space only makes up 10-15% of AUM by private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) firms. It estimates that sustainable investments would make up 40% of AUM by Indian PE and VC firms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The sovereign green bond market has grown exponentially, from issuing as little over $11 billion in 2013 to about $568 billion in 2021. Cumulatively, the total market has surpassed $1 trillion. More than 25 countries have issued green bonds since 2013. These green bonds raise money from the market to finance projects that only have environmental or climate benefits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687785207/cl3hrgtofgt4nxvh5vwz.png\" style=\"width: 1000px; height: 799px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian government is making a debut by issuing Rs 16,000 crore worth of green bonds by March 2023 through issuing sovereign green bonds (the first auction is on 25 January and 9 February). While the Indian government has joined late, our private companies have been pretty active, having already raised $26 billion through corporate green bond issues. Foreign portfolio investors are eyeing our green bonds since they have a dedicated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moreover, the Indian government is taking many steps to achieve its objectives. In August 2022, Energy Conservation Amendment Bill 2022 was tabled to amend the Energy Conservation Act 2001, empowering the central government to specify a carbon credit trading scheme. India requires an annual investment of USD 0.6 trillion (Impact Investors Council (IIC) 2020) to meet its UN Sustainable Development Goals. According to the International Energy Agency, India requires $1.4 trillion over the next 20 years in financing green energy tech alone. Just India&rsquo;s electric vehicle transition offers an investment opportunity of $177 billion and a sales opportunity of $206 billion by 2030.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Increasing reform measures include several voluntary and mandatory guidelines to drive ethical corporate behavior and reporting on material ESG factors. SEBI has also come forward and provided a mandate to the top 1000 companies (listed) to come up with an annual report on Business responsibility and sustainability, voluntary for the financial year 2022. However, it is mandatory from FY 2023, which will eventually help the fund houses to evaluate the companies on different ESG metrics and select the best out of the lot. They will force large Indian companies to take a holistic view of sustainability.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ESG Investments in India, though at a nascent stage, are evolving fast. The possible reasons behind this encouraging trend could be the growing consumer demand for socially responsible brand behavior, government policies, and the massive growth of cleantech and green initiatives in recent years. The current thrust on climate change and upscaling green energy investments highlights the country&rsquo;s focus on and need for ESG investments. The global commitments made by the government are clear indications of its focus.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Numerous developments and measures have led to the growth of ESG investing in India. In recent years, quite a few indices (S&amp;P BSE Greenex, S&amp;P BSE Carbonex, S&amp;P BSE 100 ESG Index, NIFTY 100 ESG Index, NIFTY 100 Enhanced ESG Index ) have come up to track, monitor, and measure the ESG performance of various companies. India&rsquo;s Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) asset base stands at USD 28 billion, 0.1 percent of the global SRI assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For having a better future, ESG investing is crucial. Investing in companies making an effort to reduce their carbon footprint and taking care of the well-being of the employees and society has been identified as a way for sustainability as the number of investors and investments is quickly growing, suggesting that ESG funds are here to stay. With more companies becoming aware of the benefits of sustainability, fund houses will have more options to invest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Without investors, companies cannot survive. Thus if investors become aware of the benefit and need for sustainable investing, companies are bound to follow the same. However, investors want to see their investments grow. ESG investment is one of the most lucrative investment options as it offers an opportunity to screen for better business fundamentals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The ESG investing approaches range from a simple exclusionary screen based on norms or values (exclusions-based screening) to an ESG integration process, where ESG considerations are applied to the fundamental cash flow analysis or security selection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Companies increasingly derive value from intangible assets not captured in their balance sheets, like their people, use of natural capital, and reputation. Therefore analysts are well-served by analyzing the non-financial information captured by the ESG factors, not only to improve their fundamental analysis but also to assess the companies on risk dimensions. Companies with poor governance or failing to consider environmental and social impacts are unlikely to prosper over the long term. Funds that do not consider ESG factors are not fulfilling their fiduciary duty towards investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investor interest in ESG investing has been increasing in recent years. According to the 2020 CFA Institute Trust Survey conducted across 15 major markets, including India, only 19% of institutional investors and 10% of retail investors currently invest in products that incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. But 76% of institutional and 69% of retail investors expressed interest in ESG. Another study by Standard Chartered, The Wealth Expectancy Report 2022, has found. Fifty-two percent of global investors expect to increase their sustainable investments in 2023, compared to 64 percent in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To conclude, remember whatever decision we make can impact the environment, either as a person or as a business. It may not show now, but we will live with the repercussions in a few years. Let us pledge to build, exhibit and inculcate good financial habits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Specifically, in the context of Indian Sovereign green bonds, an individual retail investor may be better off with a &lsquo;wait and watch&rsquo; strategy, owing to uncertainty concerning tax incentives and expectation of a lower interest rate offered.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the auspicious festive occasion, aim to harvest the benefits of your investments. Focus on harvesting long-term happiness by selecting the investment avenues that can generate inflation-adjusted higher returns for growing your wealth over time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>Anything we do is to save &ldquo;us,&rdquo; not the planet.

Debt or Equity?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing in equity gives us higher return and help us build wealth. But this is the sole reason for equity to be smarter than debt. On the other hand, debt has many reasons with evidence to be smarter than equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A stock market is always an emotional place where the equity price is driven by investor sentiments and, sometimes, fake news. All these may create greater volatility or &lsquo;noise&rsquo; in the market. Meanwhile debt market runs on facts and figures, with economic trends holding the reins of prices. Any monetary policy changes bring rapid price movements in the debt market, while those changes may never impact the equity market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If we consider market size, the debt market wins over the equity market. According to the data published by the Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, the international bond market was worth $128.9 trillion at the end of 2021, while the market capitalization of the global equity market stood at $124.4 trillion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Opportunity cost is a significant factor that comes between equity and debt investing. Bond yields are the key to calculating the opportunity cost of equity investing. If the bond yields go up, the opportunity cost of equity investing increases, making equity less attractive for investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When bond yield increases, corporates have to pay higher interest on the debt. So as the cost of servicing debt increases, the risk of default and bankruptcy also increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is undeniable that most financial scams in recorded history have been associated with the debt market. As a result, it prompts policymakers to take caution while making economic policies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You must pay the risk premium to get a higher return from equity investments. But you can earn a decent return without taking much risk in the debt market. So, owing to their contrary natures, both asset class has significance in any investment portfolio. In other words, debt and equity are inevitable assets in our wealth creation journey.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Investing!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Neeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687786963/fc6ryct7bgkxfj8cg5m6.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Debt or Equity?

Some families operate a family office primarily to make private investments and create more wealth. This type of family office acts as a family&rsquo;s asset allocator and internal fund manager who manages their private hedge funds and equity funds. On the other hand, some families set up family offices for asset protection and the welfare of family members. With a welfare-centric approach, these family offices work with professionals to create and manage trusts, sign up for insurance, draft and implement family constitutions, support family councils, organize family meetings, handle immigration and settle disputes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite this categorization, what makes a family office unique is its determination to provide its High Net-Worth Individual (HNI) and Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individual (UHNI) clients with a full range of customized financial and personal services. Whether it&rsquo;s financial advisory, asset management, legal, or concierge services, Family Office goes the extra mile and adds a personal touch to assist their HNI and UHNI clients. Family offices typically work with clients with an asset size of 50 crores to 100 crores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Partnering with a family office comes with a wide variety of benefits that are significantly distinct from the benefits offered by any standard wealth management firm. The significant advantages are described below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Visionary Wealth Creators:</strong>&nbsp;Family offices have a long-term approach to wealth creation. They invest in various assets or businesses in radically different time frames than traditional wealth management firms. It is because a Family Office&rsquo;s goal is to create long-lasting wealth for their clients that can be passed down from generation to generation. So, family offices often mentor the younger generation within HNI and UHNI families in addition to financial services. They play the role of facilitators and communicators for their clients during their wealth transfer, succession planning, and business administration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Personalised Wealth Management Approach:</strong>&nbsp;Family offices strictly avoid the commission-based model, a norm for traditional wealth management firms and investment advisors. This move helps family offices remain aligned with their client&rsquo;s interests. This approach allows them to create personalized wealth management solutions based on their client&rsquo;s priorities. Whether it is investing in a holiday resort or a Food and Beverages (F&amp;B) company, family offices suggest investment plans based on parameters other than Return on Investment (ROI). It is because they are looking at it from the utility perspective of their clients. This way, family offices always keep their client&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Solid Trust:&nbsp;</strong>Family offices develop deep bonds with the HNI and UHNI family members. This deep bonding creates a great trust that eventually materializes into a deeper understanding of a family&rsquo;s financial vision and goals. It allows family offices to better align wealth creation strategies per their client&rsquo;s vision and mission.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Wealth Management during Crises:&nbsp;</strong>The CoVID-19 pandemic has displayed that Black Swan events would be common in the future. Hence, we must prepare for possibilities derailing anyone&rsquo;s financial future. Family offices have under one roof financial professionals from tax experts to investment advisors specializing in domestic and international markets. It helps them cater to their clients during uncertain economic downturns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Undoubtedly, every HNI or UHNI needs sophisticated financial expertise. However, to build a long-lasting legacy, HNIs need to rely on trustworthy partners who can protect and appreciate their wealth. Family offices are made to do just that. Family offices help HNIs to realize their dreams by anticipating their needs, freeing up their schedules, and taking from their shoulders the responsibility of wealth management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. A Cost-Effective Wealth Management Structure:</strong>&nbsp;If you are an HNI, a family office lets you hire an expert team to take care of your portion of transgenerational wealth creation. On top of that, a family office is an amalgamation of resources that lets you save money. As the talents and skills are in the office, you don&rsquo;t need to pay for an outside financial advisory service. In addition, a family office often focuses more on asset management than personal finance. They also provide tax and charity planning and the coordination of buying and managing assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. Efficient Supervision and Time Saver:&nbsp;</strong>Families holding a smoothly functioning family office save tons of time. It is done through delegating investment management and other activities and streamlining their supervision. With efficient investment governance in place, maintenance of a family office is more like operating any other business. Families can design and implement an efficient supervision structure and process with clear-cut reporting, dashboards, investment analysis, performance metrics, and other procedures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investment governance enables the family to don the role of strategic owners and lets them remain in the driver&rsquo;s seat without taking on the operator role. This strategic supervision role frees up their time to build value in other ways. This shift in ownership is crucial for families in today&rsquo;s turbulent investment ecosystem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>7. Greater Returns:&nbsp;</strong>Family offices have several qualities that help them give higher risk-adjusted returns to their clients. First, they allocate capital efficiently in a customized way for a particular family by using institutional-quality investment avenues. Second, they meticulously select investments without relying on third-party financial service providers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Among the several reasons that hold families together, financial performance is the primary one. It inspires them to pool their capital, collaborate to achieve their financial and personal goals, grows their wealth, and transfer it to another generation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When a family sets up a structured family office, it allows them to discuss their financial goals, family values, time horizons, risk appetite, and mission and vision. In this setup, families are more likely to achieve their wealth-building goals. It also opens up more exciting investment opportunities, career development of the younger generation, and more capital to meet the expanding needs of a family over generations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687787164/sxq0cnislzg5wsfohklr.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Top Benefits of Associating with A Family Office","seo_keywords":"Top Benefits of Associating with A Family Office","seo_description":"A formal definition has yet to be given to ‘Family Office.’ One way to define Family Office is to divide it into two categories.

In addition, these ultra-rich families have Single Family Office or SFOs that strives to beat the performance of private banks and other investment firms. Therefore, it is interesting to delve deeper into how family wealth is managed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The history of SFOs dates back to Major Domus (head of the house) and Major Domo (chief steward) employed by ancient and medieval Roman empires, respectively. Today&rsquo;s SFO emerged in the mid-19th century by creating private banks and trust companies for families that made fortunes in the Industrial Revolution. Today, SFOs are also operated for entrepreneurial families.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A typical SFO requires an operating cost of around ₹20 crores a year. So, other wealthy individuals and families often create entities known as Multifamily Offices (MFOs) to carry out profitable yet affordable wealth management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Objectives of Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The primary objective of a Family Office is trans-generational wealth management. Second, they are created to consolidate accounting, tax, and estate planning services. Other goals of a Family Office include freedom of career choice for family members; cost-effective money management; stable yet scalable asset management; trustworthy and loyal employees; and cheaper document administration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An independent investment advisor may have other interests. Similarly, an investment firm might be a business that runs on a fee or a large financial institution that is more focused on selling its products. Today, more Family Offices seem to be moving toward portfolio management. Yet they can protect against conflicts of interest and prioritize the family interests.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Partnership with Banks</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Single Family Offices do not manage family funds directly. Instead, they work alongside banks, investment managers, and asset management companies to set the strategy and protect and grow the family portfolio. As a result, SFOs complement banks. Most of their work is outsourced to the banks, and the banks turn into partners rather than competitors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the family office business, partnering with banks is a positive trend. The most crucial benefit for Family Office is better access to Information Technology (IT) to generate timely yet comprehensive reports related to investment management. Standalone family offices need help to continuously invest in expensive IT infrastructure that helps to make optimal investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An efficient IT infrastructure also helps many Family Offices to offer &lsquo;door keeping&rsquo; services, such as managing homes, vehicles, and payments, hiring staff, and guiding philanthropy. The SFO also helps to keep family unity and achieve common objectives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Governance Practices to Ensure Accountability</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Governance is essential in Family Office setup. The governance structure of family offices reflects the families that fund them. Efficient family offices have explicit governance practices that hold the professionals accountable. It has been done by implementing pre-determined benchmarks, regular evaluations based on solid criteria, and transparent reporting. The combination of accountability and objectivity contributes to building trust, a key reason to have a family office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The family members participate in family office governance. They may do it either informally or through established committees. On top of that, there are mission statements and operating agreements in administration. These elements guide family members to make genuine governance commitments based on a shared vision of the family office. The visions may include a family&rsquo;s expected results from its family office, the financial and time commitments, and its ability to ensure efficient operation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most wealthy families appoint a family member to run their SFO; the rest hire financial professionals from outside. More affluent families are more likely to hire outsiders to manage their money. Some families hire investment managers from the family business to head their SFO as they have experience in running a family business and the family. On the flip side, other families avoid hiring professionals from the family business because they want to separate the family wealth from the company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Significance of Discretion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Discretion is crucial for SFO employees who manage the fortunes of families whose endless wealth might put them in the public eye. Therefore, most SFOs have no website and never advertise their services. On the other hand, some high-profile wealthy families don&rsquo;t care much about discretion. So it depends more on the nature of the business and the family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Discretion in family office business is a straightforward concept. Still, it becomes challenging at times, mainly when certain assets, such as a privately held business or property, are owned jointly by separate family members.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Few Suggestions for SFOs</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To conclude this article, it would be apt to give three significant suggestions for SFOs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First, having a purpose matters more in the family office business. It enhances the performance of a family office. An efficient Family Office would mostly connect to families with a strong sense of purpose when dealing with their fortune. These families invest not only their money or assets but also their enthusiasm in pursuing something beyond mere wealth preservation and appreciation. This sense of purpose may include a wide range of objectives. Some include involvement in entrepreneurial activities, worthy causes, and philanthropic pursuits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Second, the families must strive for excellence in every area of their family office. In other words, nepotism has no place in the family office, and family politics never compromise the professionalism of their SFO.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Third, segmenting tasks can improve performance. A highly paid fund manager should not be distracted by dealing with the car fleet or collecting the laundry. Some SFOs deal with dormant companies of the family. This creates problems for family members in properly supervising their SFO&rsquo;s decision-making. Spending time, interest, or expertise on unnecessary and unprofitable tasks cost</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687787816/srxfivoim6mna6hluy90.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How Do the Richest Families in The World Manage Their Wealth?","seo_keywords":"How Do the Richest Families in The World Manage Their Wealth?","seo_description":"Most businesses worldwide are family businesses, and several features, such as succession and governance, make family business management unique.

Even if you are lucky enough to avoid loans, credit cards never let you escape from the circle of debt. Banks are aggressive in filling up their loan book with &lsquo;performing&rsquo; assets, which are payments in your monthly budget. So, home loans, car loans, education loans, personal loans, and collateralized loans are readily available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All is well when you pay your Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) regularly, but everything goes topsy turvy when you fail to pay them. Unfortunately, businesses and entrepreneurs face similar situations when they default on their business loans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the case of collateralized loans, banks get the sanction from the court to auction or dispose of the property or security to retrieve the loan. But on the other hand, if the collateral is insufficient to cover the loan, the creditor &ndash; Banks or Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) &ndash; would pressure you to reimburse the loan soon, or they will approach the court for an attachment order. Moreover, in the event of the borrower&rsquo;s demise, the creditor can approach the court, causing trouble to the borrower&rsquo;s family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Hence, it is essential to understand the investment avenues that are shielded from creditors. These investment avenues are also known as creditor-proof investments. Therefore, a court of law cannot attach these investments, or a creditor cannot auction them to retrieve the loan amount.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A few of the creditor-proof investments include the following:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Investment under Irrevocable Trust:&nbsp;</strong>Any investment under irrevocable Trust is protected from creditors and court. Since it is an irrevocable trust, an individual can transfer their personal assets to these Trusts, but assets cannot be transferred from the Trusts to an individual. Irrevocable Trust function under the trust deed and in favor of the Trust&rsquo;s beneficiaries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A Trust is an independent legal entity, and a court cannot attach it unless the fraudulent motive of a borrower is proved in court. Therefore, creating a Trust requires expert advice from lawyers and chartered accountants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Assigning Life Insurance Policies:</strong>&nbsp;Assignment of policies means that rights on the policy are transferred to a lender, a relative, or any person. The policyholder assigning the policy rights is called the assignor, and the person to whom rights have been transferred is called the assignee. Once the assignment of the policy has been transferred from assignor to assignee, then policy holder&rsquo;s right to the life insurance policy gets canceled. So, the court cannot attach the policy rights of the debtor if they default.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. The Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act (MWP):</strong>&nbsp;The MWP act came into existence to protect women belonging to any religion or caste from relatives, creditors, and even husbands. Under this act, women can take insurance policies and shield them from attachment by a court. Section 6 of the MWP act allows married men to carry life insurance policies to benefit their wives and children. Married women can take policy under the MWP act and keep their children as nominees. However, even husbands don&rsquo;t have the right to claim the benefits from those policies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On top of that, enrolling in insurance policies under the MWP act is very easy. We can do it by filling out an additional form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Public Provident Fund (PPF):</strong>&nbsp;PPF is an excellent investment that can give an investor around 7.5% post-tax return. It also qualifies for tax deduction under section 80c. Any withdrawal from the fund is also tax-free. As per the PPF act of 1968, the court cannot attach the fund for payment to the creditor. But, in case of default or fraudulent activities, the income tax authorities can seize it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. National Pension Scheme (NPS):&nbsp;</strong>As per the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) act of 2015, NPS under Tier 1 account cannot be attached by the court in case of a default by the pensioner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. Professional Indemnity Insurance:</strong>&nbsp;This insurance protects professionals and businesses in case of any negligence or error that has brought heavy loss to their clients. Companies or professionals who directly work with customers are suggested to have professional indemnity cover because a customer with evil intentions may also sue the business even if no error, mistake, or negligence has been made by the company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Credit-proof investments are legitimate ways to protect your hard-earned wealth. However, individuals must avail of these facilities with rightful intention rather than just for protection from creditors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">N.B.: The objective of this article is to bring awareness.

These wealth management firms differ from traditional investment management companies as they offer comprehensive financial solutions to an HNWI or family. For instance, along with wealth management and financial planning, family offices provide budgeting, insurance services, charity planning, inheritance transfer, succession planning, tax services, and many more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The credit for establishing the first-ever comprehensive family office goes to John D. Rockefeller, an American business magnate considered the wealthiest American of all time. He founded his family office in 1882. When he died in 1937, his family office managed around $1.5 billion, roughly $255 billion in today&rsquo;s value. The Rockefeller family office exists even to this day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Types of Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealthy families may require various solutions to issues such as succession and inheritance planning. They may also set up trusts or foundations to manage or disperse family assets. Given the complexity of these processes, they can utilize a family office to aid these processes and interests. In addition, a family office can also provide non-financial services such as schooling, travel planning, event management, and household arrangements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Two significant types of family offices exist: Single-Family Offices (SFOs) and Multi-Family Offices (MFOs). SFOs serve a single ultra-wealthy family, while MFOs deal with more high-net-worth families. The latter is more inclined towards traditional wealth management practices. As a result, they work for more families and provide cost-effective services as they share their management fees among the clientele.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Duties of a Family Office</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Providing financial advice and services for ultra-wealthy families is far beyond the scope of a single professional investment advisor. Instead, it requires a well-managed yet collaborative effort by a team of professionals in legal, insurance, investment, estate, and tax. In short, the family office helps wealthy families navigate the complex world of asset and lifestyle management. Some of the significant duties of a family office include the following.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Legacy Management and Transfer</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After several generations of accumulating wealth, ultra-wealthy families face several complex obstacles when they try to manage and maximize their legacy. A comprehensive inheritance transfer plan must include the transfer of business interests, the estate settlement, the management of family trusts, and philanthropic activities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Lifestyle Management</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many family offices handle a wealthy family&rsquo;s personal affairs and cater to their lifestyle needs. These services include providing private security, travel planning, and streamlining business affairs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Financial Education</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A family office offers financial education for the younger members of the wealthy family. It may include the management of immense wealth that matches the family values and aspirations. In this way, the family office instills a sense of appreciation for wealth in the next generations. In addition, proper financial education maintains family unity and prevents conflicts over inheritance through generations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Traditionally, a family office is an entity set up by a wealthy family to manage its vast wealth. This entity has a team of experts who protect and grow the family&rsquo;s wealth. These experts include financial advisors, tax consultants, estate planners, accountants, and more. Moreover, they are employed by the family, so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any conflicts among them over financial products and services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another lesser-known type of family office is an outsourced family office. This family office is a network of financial service providers, including financial advisors, lawyers, and accountants, who collaborate under one client&rsquo;s instructions. Typically, one of the financial professionals is responsible for coordinating the activities of an outsourced family office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In other words, they are authorized to consult with each other only about one family&rsquo;s financial affairs. And this factor separates these asset management firms from other financial experts who provide the same services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An outsourced family office manages similar matters handled by traditional and multi-family offices. However, this type of family office is less expensive than other types of family offices, and the family holds far less control over the finance professionals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Does a Family Office Suit You?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A family office is not a one-size-fits-all financial solution. The need for a family office depends on our bank balance, the complexity of our assets, and our economic aspirations. In a broader sense, a family with one crore rupees can think about going for a multi-family office, and families that have more than 10 crore rupees worth of assets can think about establishing a single-family office. Some scenarios may require a wide variety of financial specialists with access to high-end resources that can address a long list of complex issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Family offices are expensive to establish and time-consuming to operate. So, only the highly wealthy individual or families with complex personal and investment needs usually require a family office set up. On the other hand, families with assets less than one crore rupees can access the financial services of a professional wealth management firm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A family office is not the same as a wealth advisory firm. They can offer some of the services of a family office, such as portfolio and investment management. However, wealth advisory firms typically have various clients, while a traditional family office focuses on one client. On the other hand, a multi-family office handles several clients. In addition, family offices offer a more comprehensive array of financial services to address the wealth-related needs of an ultra-rich family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To clarify the points, a high net-worth family set up a family office for various reasons. The first and most significant is the need to manage and grow their wealth. Towards this end, a family office has to provide a wide range of financial services that could help a family to sail smoothly through the complexities of the processes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While a single-family office may be appropriate for some ultra-wealthy individuals or families, a multi-family office can handle most of the investment needs of a highly affluent family. Sometimes, a wealth advisory firm is a better option for some wealthy people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687788336/yvimlelpcjexnp2l85ij.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Understanding Family Offices","seo_keywords":"Understanding Family Offices","seo_description":"A family office is a privately operated wealth management firm that provides tailored financial services for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (HNWI).

Brighter yet financially literate children will light up the future of our economy. Unfortunately, the financial education scenario is bleak in most parts of our world. Although money has a significant role to play in our lives, we fail to teach about money to our children, let alone talk to them about money. Most parents try to inculcate good habits and impart knowledge about every aspect of our lives during different stages of their kids&rsquo; life. But, again, they ignore imparting financial education to their children. As per a recent survey, only 16.7% of Indian teenagers are financially literate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Relevance of Financial Literacy for Kids</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Financial literacy will teach kids to value money and inculcate money management skills that will help them in their adult life. It lets them understand their country&rsquo;s and global economies, particularly during crises. When we open the door of financial literacy to children, they get inspired to create wealth and become financially independent sooner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Financial literacy is just as crucial as other basics in life. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed including the financial literacy program with school education. It shows the relevance of financial literacy for kids.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Right Age for Financial Education</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The earlier, the better. The latest research has shown that parents can impart financial education to their toddlers at three. At that age, kids will get introduced to numbers, and the basics of finance go well with it, making the learning process fun. We can also impart financial education to children of any age as per their level of comprehension.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>How Can We Teach Children About Money?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The learning process depends on a child&rsquo;s age, and a systematic approach should be followed in their financial education. For example, we can introduce the concept of currency to toddlers by taking them to the market and showing them how to buy things using cash. In this way, they can learn about how value changes hands in our society. Playing shopping games at home also helps.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Games like Monopoly are good for school-going kids as they introduce them to savings, investing, and wealth building. We can also give them pocket money and ask them to save in a piggy bank.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">During their teenage, we can introduce them to banks so that they can save their pocket money in their savings account.

Brighter yet financially literate children will light up the future of our economy. Unfortunately, the financial education scenario is bleak in most parts of our world. Although money has a significant role to play in our lives, we fail to teach about money to our children, let alone talk to them about money. Most parents try to inculcate good habits and impart knowledge about every aspect of our lives during different stages of their kids’ life. But, again, they ignore imparting financial education to their children. As per a recent survey, only 16.7% of Indian teenagers are financially literate.","seo_blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687842940/allty9ntvc7cj7bt7ock.webp","created_at":"Jun 27, 2023"},{"blog_id":"39","title":"Dreaming of Investing Like A Billionaire? Knock on a Family Office’s Door!","slug":"dreaming-of-investing-like-a-billionaire-knock-on-a-family-offices-door","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1669007769","published_date_view":"Nov 21, 2022","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Family offices &mdash; small yet private wealth management firms &ndash; were set up to solely serve the investment needs of a single ultrarich family. The families who had their own family offices are worth at least $500 million. But, as the operating costs of single-family offices stand at $1 million annually, their services have been reserved only for the creamy layer of the upper class.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">But the scenario has changed today. Family offices are opening their doors to a broader investor class to help them cut down their management fees and create a new investment venture. So, the services available only for families with more than $100 million in assets are now available to families with as little as $5 million in liquid assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">A new breed of wealth management firm called the multifamily office is at the heart of this change. It operates much like a family office: Staffed by professional wealth managers, accountants, lawyers, and personal assistants, they take care of every need of the ultrawealthy, from doing family taxes, planning charities, setting up trusts to booking the private jet, and hiring nannies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">History has shown that many of the top multifamily offices began as single-family offices for well-known wealthy families. Again, we can take Rockefeller &amp; Co. as an excellent example. John D. Rockefeller&rsquo;s family office was founded in the 1880s, and a century later, it was among the first to open its doors to outside investors. Their multifamily office now manages the wealth and offers every financial service to around 180 wealthy families with at least $50 million in assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Another example is the Grace family based in Philadelphia. Eugene G. Grace, the patriarch of the family, is the founder of Bethlehem Steel company. After running the company for over four decades, he turned its family office into Ashbridge Investment Management. Today his family office accepts investments from other families with $10 million or more in assets. Similarly, the Pittsburgh-based Pitcairn family, which built a plate-glass empire, turned its family office into Pitcairn Financial Group. In contrast, the Whittier Trust Co., founded by the Whittier family, a California-based oil baron, serves 150 clients through their family office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The history of these families reveals that they are good at building and maintaining wealth. So, they are well prepared to help other wealthy families to grow their fortunes. They can also pass their clients their vast experience in dealing with wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Now, multifamily offices are providing the same services as single-family offices by spreading the costs out over many wealthy families. Several multifamily offices have been cropping up recently to offer investment services to clients with $10 million or more in liquid funds. In addition, a few multifamily offices recently lowered the entry bar to $5 million in assets. This move broke off an industry barrier that no one ever thought possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Due to their personalized services and freedom from financial conflicts, multifamily offices are becoming competitors to private banks, brokerages, and trust companies that serve High Net worth Individuals (HNIs) and families.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Although multifamily offices are highly elite financial services firms, their management fees are decreasing, making them more attractive to ultrarich families. On top of that, multifamily offices become even more accessible as they scale up and become more efficient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Entry of Big Banks into the Game</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Several large banks are turning into multifamily offices to attract more wealthy clients. For example, SunTrust Banks Inc. acquired Asset Management Advisors (AMA), a rapidly growing Florida-based multifamily office that has been opening new offices nationwide and now has around 250 family clients. Another example is Credit Suisse Private Banking. It has bought Frye-Louis Capital Management, a Chicago-based family office launched by the ultrarich Louis family.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Similar to banks, a good number of brokerages and trust companies offer what they call &lsquo;holistic wealth management.&rsquo; But what they do is sell their investment products, and they lack the intensely personalized investment services of multifamily offices. That includes paying bills and planning taxes to handling inheritance spanning several generations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Offering a Personal Touch in Investments</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Multifamily offices have other personalized offers for clients. Need a family vacation? They will handle it. Need to transport your near and dear ones from one place to another? They will do that, too. Wealth managers of multifamily offices travel to their client&rsquo;s offices or homes for meetings and usually visit their clients at least once a quarter. For that reason, multifamily offices have spare offices and rarely open branches apart from their headquarters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Most well-run family offices follow a &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; approach to wealth planning. They make their clients fill out a questionnaire designed to understand the personality profiles of every significant family member. The test also aims to prevent family conflicts and develop a family &lsquo;mission statement&rsquo; that guides everything from personal spending to philanthropy. The company also counsels families on the psychological dimensions of identity and wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">From making gifts to paying bills, multifamily offices maintain a close relationship with a family. They also provide simple yet easy-to-understand financial statements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Inherent Pitfalls</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Multifamily offices also have pitfalls. For example, inherent conflicts exist in multifamily offices dominated by a single wealthy family as the founding family has ultimate control over investments, and the office may not give the same level of service to others. In addition, many family offices, like those run by Rockefellers and Graces, don&rsquo;t disclose their Assets Under Management (AUM), making it difficult for other clients to assess their power of control.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The primary reason a family becomes a multifamily office is to manage their investments. So, it is hard to know if the best investment managers in the family office are giving real opportunities and attention to the founding family or to other clients.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687843162/yzkm7sozioi2wacscquz.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Dreaming of Investing Like A Billionaire?

They have pursued business deals ranging from acquiring realty to seeding hedge funds to buying businesses. Today, their numbers are increasing, and many, weary of higher fees and below-average performance of professional wealth managers, are embracing direct investing strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Wealthy families with nine-figure fortunes &ndash; individually or as a group &ndash; are increasingly impinging on investment banking and Private Equity (PE). Traditionally, such business transactions were the province of large corporates, fund houses, or PE firms. But this change in investment strategies of wealthy families has given birth to a disruptive force in the investment world: the family office. These firms, created to manage the fortunes of the rich, can operate under the radar of the regulatory system. Their number is growing along with the size of their fat wallets and hunger for deals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Just think about a group of over 100 ultra-rich families pursuing investments like acquisitions through unregulated financial firms called family offices. Historically, they have been operated as a group, but today they have become an inevitable part of the investment world.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Family Office: A Disruptive Force</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Ms. Carol Bernick is the heir to Alberto Culver Co., a hair-care company built by her father. Her family created a family office in 2002 to manage assets outside their stake in the company. The office had no formal name but only one employee. Alberto Culver was sold to Unilever PLC for nearly $4 billion In 2011, swelling the assets of the family office, which was named Polished Nickel Capital Management LLC. Today, the family office, helmed by Ms. Bernick as its CEO, has 14 employees and makes Private Equity investments alongside other families and PE firms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Family offices are becoming more like financial institutions in their approach &ndash; some sort of &lsquo;insti-viduals.&rsquo; Wealthy families with a minimum of $250 million in assets prefer to put their money to work through family offices. It is because family offices allow complete control and secrecy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Examples of family offices include the one started by hedge-fund manager William Ackman and Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch have their family office named 1888 Management LLC to manage a small portion of their $86 billion fortune. Oprah Winfrey, the legendary American talk show host, has OW Management LLC to manage her wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">There are multifamily offices that invest on behalf of wealthy families. Quadrant Capital Advisors, a New York-based multifamily office, invests $14 billion worth of assets on behalf of Colombia&rsquo;s Santo Domingo family. Similarly, Fremont Group, another multifamily office, invests the wealth of the Bechtel family, which runs a construction behemoth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Family offices are unregulated firms, so counting them takes work. But, globally, it has been estimated that there are more than 10,000 family offices. About half of them were set up in the past 15 years. In the US, around 3,000 family offices manage more than $1.2 trillion in assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The family offices collaborate with buyout firms and compete against the firms that do mergers and acquisitions. In addition, they finance start-ups and buy distressed debt, real estate, and exotic insurance products. Family offices vigorously hunt talents from the investing world to do all these financial adventures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Fertile Ground for Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">In the past, it took 100 years to make $100 million. But today, the wealth-building process has become much faster mainly because of the entrepreneurs in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and elsewhere. With the rise in billionaires worldwide, their collective wealth touched nearly $13 trillion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">This surge in wealth globally in the past few decades is partially responsible for the proliferation of family offices worldwide utilizing the higher levels of merger and acquisition activities and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). As a result, family offices hold assets worth more than $4 trillion globally, an amount of wealth nearly touching the $6 trillion assets of PE firms and hedge funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Since 2011, several hedge funds have converted into family offices after returning their clients&rsquo; money. Soros Fund Management was one among them. Mr. Soros cited increasing regulation as one reason. U.S. regulators require hedge funds that manage more than $150 million in assets to disclose their strategies and the size of their portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The private investing world is the only place where we can capture outsize returns and protect capital. It is the hidden world where multibillion-dollar fortunes are made in direct deals that perform independently from the stock market. Private investment firms like Perot Investments in the US set up family office networks that help wealthy families with assets of at least $1 billion to strike PE deals and discuss investing strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Banks Eyeing Family Offices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Investment banks like Goldman Sachs began to pay more attention to family offices as they realized they were losing out on merger deals involving family offices. They treat these family offices the same way they treat large buyout firms. Prominent investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley have given special attention to these family offices. Recently, they have appointed senior banking professionals to cover family offices. Also, PE firms invite family offices to be their ideal partners because of the latter&rsquo;s appetite to invest directly into companies rather than through funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Buyout firms like Blackstone Group LP and KKR &amp; Co. have seen an ocean of wealth in private investing. So, they woo families with flexible private investing opportunities. These financial firms also compel every employee to develop a short list of wealthy families as they look forward to setting up their multifamily office. KKR now has several hundred wealthy families as their family office clients, up from zero in 2010.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Indian Family Office Story</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The family office trend has been gaining popularity in India in recent years. Today, there are around 300 family offices in the country, each managing an average Asset Under Management (AUM) of $100 million. Some even manage assets worth multi-billion dollars. Prominent entrepreneurs like Gautam Adani, Ratan Tata, Azim Premji, and NR Narayana Murthy have family offices. Similarly, India&rsquo;s media and sports celebrities like Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and Akshay Kumar have jumped on the family office bandwagon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Like Perot Investments in the US, multifamily offices like Alpha Capital help wealthy Indian families to foray into the new age exotic investment world</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687843373/iwvnjvpw2ihwuayuiofg.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Family Office: The New Force on The Investment World","seo_keywords":"The Family Office: The New Force on The Investment World","seo_description":"Historically, wealthy families have always found ways to build and protect fortunes.

The five-day festival of lights got over with cheer and optimism. Dhanteras is the day of fortune, and Naraka Chaturdashi is celebrated as the day of knowledge. Indeed, Diwali is all about shining bright and spreading light. Annakut/Padwa/Govardhan puja depicts an auspicious start.

With these festivities, there was a lot of free time (courtesy of super long weekends), and with discounts offered everywhere and on everything, it&rsquo;s difficult to resist the temptation to splurge!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">But now, let&rsquo;s put our act together and focus on our investments with renewed energy. The need for diversification has been significantly accentuated, especially after the COVID-19 crisis, and identifying the best hedging opportunities is prominent. With the start of the 4th Industrial revolution, one can see the emergence of technology-based or digital assets, as popularly referred to, cannot be ignored when looking at alternative asset classes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and FinTech are the outcomes of the 4th Industrial revolution era and has substantial implications in emerging economies. Blockchain technology creates an ecosystem of trust and is increasingly used in various industries, from finance to healthcare. AI and Robotics spearhead the disruption in the production process, be it healthcare, agriculture, hospitality, manufacturing, or the military. Clear evidence is a 150% increase in the shipment of robots from 2010 to 2016. Their ability to reduce the cost of production and give a fillip to innovation is substantial in the context of emerging markets. Lastly, fintech is the marriage of finance and technology. It helps unlock potential benefits by offering user-friendly, decentralized, efficient, and transparent digital-based financial services to its customer, triggering sustainable economic growth through financial inclusion and green finance. Emerging Markets, backed by high growth and weak efficiencies, make a lucrative investment for investors and are always a priority investment for foreign institutional investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Diversification opportunities exist for investors investing in emerging markets with technology-based funds. But over the years, higher media coverage and stronger investor interest have created closer linkages with traditional assets, leading to deteriorated diversification benefits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Thus, do capture the diversification benefits of technology-based assets with full awareness. First, evaluate your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and objectives before investing. Moreover, let not Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) sentiment be the motivation when making investment decisions as it can understate the perception of risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687843964/aizuzi3q3a49qdmuphbg.webp\" style=\"width: 1192px; height: 787px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">More often than not, we suffer from the illusion of explanatory depth or knowledge, as illustrated by two researchers at Yale ‒Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil, some 20 years ago. It was a simple experiment where they asked a group of students to rate on a scale of 1-7 how well they understood how zippers worked. As you might expect, most responses were at the upper end of the scale. After receiving their initial reaction, they requested students first to illustrate how zippers worked and then rate their level of understanding once again on a scale of 1 to 7. Suppose you were subconsciously participating in this experiment while reading. In that case, you must have realized that the ratings were lower (by a couple of points) than the first time. What you just appreciated in the context of zippers holds for everything in life &ndash; bicycles, pandemics, economics, politics, and technology. We all assume that we understand things better than we do, even when we don&rsquo;t.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">To guard ourselves against this illusion, stay curious and resist the temptation to say &ldquo;I know&rdquo;. Lastly, as often said that teaching someone is the best way to learn. So my dear readers, remain a learner always and forever.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Best Regards<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMs. Tarunika Jain Agrawal Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687844028/jfjvhqrdxcelfzc3gtr5.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Diwali Promise – Diversification!","seo_keywords":"Diwali Promise – Diversification!","seo_description":"One of India’s most prominent festivals, Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness.

How Is It Shaping Up in India?","slug":"what-is-corporate-bond-market-how-is-it-shaping-up-in-india","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1667540037","published_date_view":"Nov 04, 2022","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">A corporate bond is a category of debt security issued by public and private corporations. The corporations issue these bonds and sell them to investors to acquire capital. The investor buying the bonds acts as a &lsquo;lender,&rsquo; and the corporation introducing the bonds is an &lsquo;issuer.&rsquo; The corporations use the raised capital for various purposes, such as building a new plant, purchasing machinery, or expanding the business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The corporate promises to return the investment (principal) on a specified maturity date. Until that day, the corporate usually pays a fixed or variable interest. When the bond expires or reaches maturity, the corporate stops the interest payments, and the principal is returned to the investor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Unlike equity stock, a corporate bond never gives the investor an ownership interest in the issuing company. Instead, the bond is backed by the corporate&rsquo;s ability to repay, which relies on its prospects for future profits. In some cases, the corporate&rsquo;s physical assets may be used as collateral.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Understanding Corporate Bonds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Although corporate bonds are considered riskier than government bonds, in general, high-quality corporate bonds are considered relatively safer yet conservative investments. The bond&rsquo;s quality is determined by the issuer&rsquo;s creditworthiness, which is reviewed by a credit rating agency. Credit rating agencies like Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL) and Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited (ICRA) do this job in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The ratings greatly influence interest rates, bond pricing, and investor appetite. Each rating agency has its own rating system. The top-rated bonds are commonly known as AAA or &lsquo;Triple-A&rsquo; rated bonds, while the lowest-rated corporate bonds are called high-yield bonds owing to their higher interest rate. This higher interest rate compensates for their higher risk. These bonds are also known as &lsquo;junk&rsquo; bonds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>How to Buy Corporate Bonds in India?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">There are a wide variety of bonds available in India. Some include plain-vanilla bonds, Public Sector Units (PSUs), and perpetual bonds. They come with short to long-term maturities, offering a wide range of returns. In addition, corporate bonds open another investment avenue for debt securities, apart from Mutual Funds (MFs).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">There are four primary ways to invest in corporate bonds in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">First, you can subscribe to primary issues floated mostly through private placements. Second, you can invest through intermediaries like bond houses. These financial intermediaries display their inventory of corporate bonds and offer sales in the size that fits only HNIs (High Net Worth Individuals).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Third, you can buy these bonds from Indian stock exchanges like National Stock Exchange (NSE) or Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) through a broker. The fourth option is online bond platforms like bondskart and the Reserve Bank of India-backed RBI Retail Direct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Issues with the Indian Corporate Bond Market</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Indian corporate bond market faces liquidity issues. If the trading volume in the equity or government securities (G-Secs) market is taken as a benchmark, the trading volume in the corporate bond market is meager.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">On top of that, transactions happen in large sizes in the Indian corporate bond market. It is because &lsquo;big players&rsquo; like banks, MFs, and insurance companies, not retail investors, are the investors in the corporate bond market. Owing to the illiquidity of bonds listed at the stock exchanges, the scope for online trading is nil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">With the advent of the latest communication technologies, several online bond platforms are cropping up, enabling you to open an account anywhere at any time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Another issue with the corporate bond market is the minimum lot size of ₹2 lakh. The rationale behind the minimum lot size is that these bond deals are usually settled through Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL). ICCL is the settlement platform of the BSE that accepts payments only through the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) process, which has a threshold of ₹2 lakh.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>A Market with Immense Growth Potential</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Today, the Indian corporate bond market is a little fragile. But the Proposed Regulatory Framework by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in July 2022 has the scope to make the structure more robust shortly. The SEBI paper suggests that, in some instances, clearing corporations of NSE or BSE can be played by online bond platforms by directly accepting funds from clients and processing over-the-counter (OTC) settlements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">This regulatory framework also takes up the instances of unlisted bonds or the value of the transaction below ₹2 lakh. It is the responsibility of the regulators to take the initiative. If the clearing platforms accept National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) payments, it will pave the way for the regulation of smaller transactions. Uniformity prevails in the system if the regulator compels every bond market participant to execute trades through the stock exchange debt segment or exchange clearing platforms for listed and unlisted debt securities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The SEBI paper also mentions that the investors would be assured that a regulatory party oversees their bond transactions. According to the framework, online bond platforms can only offer listed bonds or debt securities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The illiquidity in the secondary corporate bond market is a global issue, and our focus is on further penetration of the primary market. As per a recent RBI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/corporate-bond-outstanding-soared-fourfold-to-40-lakh-crore-in-a-decade-says-rbis-sankar/article65806725.ece\">report</a>, the Indian corporate bond market has grown nearly fourfold since 2012. The concerted efforts by the government and the regulators took the growth of the Indian corporate bond market from ₹10.4 lakh crore in March 2012 to ₹40 lakh crore in March 2022. The annual bond issuance also rose to ₹6 lakh crore from below ₹4 lakh crore during this period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">A balanced portfolio contains these junk bonds to offset the risk of equity investments. Over time, conservative investors add more bonds and fewer risky investments to safeguard their capital. Similarly, retirees often invest a more significant portion of their assets in bonds to create a reliable income source.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">With the expansion of the corporate bond market, the number of issuers and lenders, and the fleet of regulated intermediaries, these bonds offer an excellent investment avenue to diversify your portfolio per your financial needs and plans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687844287/u9bq0bps8ajugrlfgffw.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What Is Corporate Bond Market?

Be it the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the size of the economy, or the number of unicorns, Indians are keeping those numbers higher than any other developed countries. But, like night follows the day, and every coin has two sides, the flashy &lsquo;India Rising&rsquo; story has a darker side.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Here we peek into the dark side of the story that is worth a trillion dollars. It is true that India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and holds the fifth position in the world GDP ranking. But there are serious challenges that could hamper the economic growth of the country.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Let&rsquo;s look at these significant challenges one by one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Lower Per Capita Net National Income: India&rsquo;s per capita Net National Income (NNI) is $6,461, taking the country to the 128<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;world rank in per capita income. This world ranking is that of one of the poorest nations in the world.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Higher Unemployment Rate: Despite rapid economic growth, a higher unemployment rate is a severe issue in India&rsquo;s rural and urban areas. The fast-paced economic growth has left unskilled workers behind, and they are struggling to find work in promising industries. As a result, India&rsquo;s unemployment rate of 6.4% surpasses the world average unemployment rate of 5%. As per a recent UN report, India ranks number 132 among 191 countries on Human Development Index. The index&rsquo;s parameters include health, education, and per capita income.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Higher Inequality: The higher the inequality, the higher the threat to sustained economic growth and the socio-economic fabric of the society. World Inequality Data reveals an exponential rise in economic inequality in India over the past few decades. The data also states that the gap between rich and poor is among the largest of several peers and developed economies worldwide.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The Lack of Basic Amenities: This is another crucial challenge for an Indian citizen. India is poor in terms of social and economic overhead capital. Social capital includes investments in education, healthcare, and law, while economic overhead capital includes infrastructural facilities such as roads, telecommunications, and energy.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">By the way, the dark side of the &lsquo;India Rising&rsquo; story has a pinch of hope in it. In truth, the challenges in the Indian economy are opportunities in disguise. Despite these challenges, India still holds the fifth rank among the developed economies in the world. If India overcomes most of these challenges with its youthful population, nothing can stop it from becoming a world superpower at the fastest pace.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Neeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687844946/smmfrn8ps8m32gsfrmux.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Unfolding the Dark Side of the ‘India Rising’ Story","seo_keywords":"Unfolding the Dark Side of the ‘India Rising’ Story","seo_description":"India is one of the most rapidly developing countries in the world by proving its mettle in almost every area of development.

This scenario demands a transformation in the investing ecosystem. That means we must rely on the combination of traditional investment strategies and quantitative factors like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and mathematical models. This investment strategy that combines fundamental stock-picking methods and a quantitative approach is known as quantamental investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The term quantamental is a blend of &lsquo;quantitative&rsquo; and &lsquo;fundamental.&rsquo; A quantamental investment strategy also promises to deliver superior investment returns. By merging these two investing approaches, we combine human insight with computing power &ndash; a melding of man and machine. In simpler words, an investor harnesses the scalability and power of data, blending it with human insight to create winning investment strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Fundamental Investing</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Fundamental investing is the conventional bottom-up method of stock picking based on the quality of their fundamentals, such as market share and earnings. First, fundamental investors identify the stocks mispriced by the market relative to the company&rsquo;s actual market value. Then they exploit this mispricing to generate alpha or returns that could beat the market&rsquo;s or a benchmark index&rsquo;s return. Legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the best proponents of this investing approach. They use detailed balance sheet analysis, sound judgment, and investing experience to generate alpha consistently.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Quantitative Investing</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">In quantitative or quant investing, an investor or a fund manager uses mathematical models, algorithms, and invariably vast volumes of data to identify trends and patterns to predict future price movements of financial instruments. One of the common quantitative investing strategies includes statistical arbitrage, in which the quant model searches for arbitrage opportunities &mdash; identifying price differences that arise for a few seconds between identical securities in different markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Factor investing is another significant quantitative investing model. This model identifies certain factors that influence a stock price. Macroeconomic, microeconomic, and business elements such as market capitalization come under these factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Human errors like emotional and cognitive biases are eliminated when algorithms make trading or investing decisions. Unfortunately, these human errors crop up when an investment manager or fund manager makes investment decisions. So, removing this significant error is a crucial advantage of quantitative investment strategy. The quantamental investor also holds the benefit of having a substitute strategy &mdash; a backup strategy an investor can take up when the primary investment strategy fails to work according to the market conditions</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">. On the other hand, given that humans are behind the creation of algorithms, quantitative investment strategies work within the limitations of their developers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Alternative Data Boom</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Quantitative investors can confidently make investment decisions by identifying chart patterns and market trends from data. Therefore, data plays a crucial role in quantamental investing. As a result, quant investors procure as much relevant data as possible to make them better informed. This higher demand for data is responsible for the current alternative data boom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alternative data is non-traditional data such as geolocation and satellite imagery that can provide deeper insight into a particular investment avenue. For example, satellite images showing the status of the occupancy of a retailer&rsquo;s parking lot during a quarter clearly signal the retailer&rsquo;s sales volume and business performance for that period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Fund managers of top asset management companies are now paying exorbitant amounts to obtain alternative data to attain an edge over the competition. The purpose of alternative data is to make forecasts, but this process is in its infancy, with these datasets often yielding little to no valuable information. But the advancements in data-mining techniques and ML technology allow computer programs to analyze large volumes of data without human intervention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Ultimately, all these technological advancements empower asset management firms to analyze more extensive datasets and identify patterns effectively. Along with computers gaining more processing power and their storage becoming cheaper, profitable opportunities in quantitative investing are also growing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>The Current Global Quantamental Investing Scenario</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Quantamental fund managers have been entering the investing arena for the last decade and rapidly gaining the trust of big-league investors by generating the best returns in the industry. So, traditional fundamental investors have faced tight competition from this new breed of investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Similarly, active fund managers are losing ground to passive investment strategies that simply invest in a specific index at a lower cost. As a result, the last decade has witnessed passive investment tools such as Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) explode in popularity by easily outperforming active investment strategies, which charge hefty management fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Most quantamental investors began as fundamental investors who later started to absorb ideas from quantitative investment strategies. This transition also involves hiring data scientists inclined towards investing or trading who possess the skill to develop ML algorithms to derive investment insights from big datasets, which enhances the conventional stock-picking process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>A Challenging Road Ahead</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">A giant shadow of doubt hovers above the ability of conventional fundamental investors to successfully adapt to such a challenging investing discipline. Since there are huge differences between these two investing strategies, switching to quantamental investing is likely to involve sizeable organizational structural changes within an asset management firm. First, the hiring policy must be changed to employ more people with quantitative research and analysis skills. Then, they should significantly upgrade their computing systems to handle the load on resources put forward by the Big Data analytics process. Such changes can only be implemented by substantial investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">An organization&rsquo;s behavioral and cultural transformation may seem like a difficult challenge, but today&rsquo;s data-driven world demands that change. With technology beginning to play an influential role in investment and asset management, fund managers must adapt to this new paradigm to survive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Obstacles exist when taking the leap that could bridge the two investing worlds. But suppose traditional asset managers can successfully transition towards a quantamental strategy. In that case, they get a better chance of not only surviving but also evolving and ultimately thriving in this new world of investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687845360/c6hran6acw6ijy37hdef.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What Is Quantamental Investing?","seo_keywords":"What Is Quantamental Investing?","seo_description":"The term quantamental is a blend of ‘quantitative’ and ‘fundamental.’ A quantamental investment strategy also promises to deliver superior investment returns.

The situation would be like sailing a boat helplessly through a shark-infested violent sea amid never-ending thunderstorms. You may either get eaten by sharks or thrown to sea and drowned to death.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The first few years of the market performance play a vital role in the retirement corpus. If all is well, a retiree can sit back and relax; if not, negative market performance plus high inflation eats away a bigger chunk of their retirement portfolio. Consequently, the retiree&rsquo;s confidence in his retirement planning will shatter. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Of course, if your retirement is near, chances are less that it will always coincide with bullish market conditions. Therefore, Alpha Capital has come up with an analysis that can comfort individuals approaching retirement soon. The research shows that the people who retired during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, one of the worst times in financial history, are doing perfectly fine even today.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">People stepping into retirement usually have around 50% allocation in equity assets to bring double-digit growth to their retirement nest egg. For instance, a 60-year-old retired with ₹5 crore retirement fund in January 2008 (just before the onset of the subprime crisis), having a 50:50 allocation in equity and debt.&nbsp;He expects a 4% (Rs. 20 Lacs per annum) inflation-adjusted withdrawal per annum from the portfolio. Unfortunately, this scenario looks like he has made a blunder of his lifetime.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The following chart displays the performance of his retirement fund since January 2008:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687845455/oxz9jx4yihfjlnb8jb8e.webp\" style=\"width: 921px; height: 295px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above chart clearly shows that from 2008 to 2009, the retirement nest egg fell to 3.78 crores because of a withdrawal of 20 lakhs plus a negative 20% return. But the fund experienced a recovery in the following years. During those 14 years, Sensex delivered an average return of around 9%, while debt markets have given a consistent 6% return. The withdrawal of Rs. 20 lakh per year has increased every year&nbsp;to adjust for inflation. Therefore, despite high inflation during 2010-2015, the retirement fund has grown to about 6.76 crores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is a highly conservative assumption as we have fended off the role of a financial advisor in improving the portfolio performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dynamic portfolio management by a skillful financial advisor enhances the portfolio return. They achieve this in two ways. First, by diversification of the portfolio to higher return generating assets like Tech, Mid Cap, Small Cap, Mid Cap etc. Second, by doing calculated risk management for profit booking when the market is overvalued and buying equity in an undervalued market.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moral of the story: As long as you don&rsquo;t panic and sell your equity portfolio during a financial crisis, you and your portfolio will be doing well in future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If we end up in recession coupled with high inflation, as many economists anticipate, retirees can follow these tips to preserve their retirement nest egg:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1) Follow Asset Allocation Approach:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The latest research suggests that the retirement portfolio delivers maximum returns in the long term hinging on asset allocation with a retirement tenure of around 25-30 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, retirees must stick to their respective asset allocations and rebalance their portfolios whenever volatility disturbs the debt-to-equity ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During a crisis, equity allocation will get reduced compared to the policy formed. Therefore, equity buying must be done as per the policy. This way, we can buy equity at a lower price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) Don&rsquo;t Get Anxious and Lose Your Patience:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In investing, an investor has to deal more with his emotions than his money. The portfolio depletion owing to fund withdrawals and market correction might make a retiree investor restless.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Under these mental pressures, investors are prone to make wrong and impulsive decisions like trimming their equity portfolio. This is an investor&rsquo;s most common yet biggest mistake amid a crisis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor must know that the equity markets eventually recover. The only thing a retiree investor must do is to be patient and stay put with their equity portfolio.

Also, the investment avenues should provide an opportunity for diversification. When all these factors are considered, cross-border investing would be the right choice for many investors looking forward to building their wealth in innovative ways.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">All these wealth protection and appreciation features have been packed in investments in the US, European and Australian markets. Besides, an Indian has every reason to invest in international markets, also known as cross-border investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">In cross-border investing, an investor acquires a lasting interest (10 percent or more of voting rights) in an enterprise operating in an economy abroad. In other words, cross-border investing refers to an investment in an enterprise incorporated under the laws of another country. An investor can make these investments either as an individual by buying shares and debentures or as a company through mergers and acquisitions, incorporating a new company, or taking over an existing company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">A few essential things an individual going for cross-border investing should be aware of are his investment goals, the size of the investment corpus, and the taxation laws of the prospective economy. This write-up will give a brief explanation of all these factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Cross-border investing has a lower penetration among Indian investors and possesses tremendous potential for growth in the coming years. India&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is only 3 percent of the global GDP. Many listed international companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Netflix, are giving higher returns in markets. Indian markets have mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that invest in the international markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">While we can invest directly in the US equity market, only a few investment avenues are available in Japan and European markets. For instance, an individual can invest up to $25,000 with a yearly installment of less than $7,000. In addition, trustworthy banking platforms like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have tied up with US-based stock brokers. So, you can open a dollar-denominated account and invest in international markets. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Like every coin has two sides, cross-border investing has pros and cons.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Pros</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">On the flip side, there are greater chances for equity appreciation and currency depreciation. The US market has given more returns than Sensex and Nifty in the last decade, when the Indian rupee had depreciated by 3 to 4 percent for the previous few years. The advantage is that if you had invested in international stocks when one US dollar stood at ₹78 and sold when one US dollar was at ₹80, you would have benefitted from rupee depreciation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Also, one of the prominent advantages of cross-border investing is that one can invest in the most advanced technology stocks unavailable in the Indian markets. The NASDAQ ETF is just an example. So, cross-border investing is a great way to diversify your investments and get the benefit of US dollar-to-rupee conversion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Cons</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The first disadvantage of cross-border investing is the equity risk. In most cases, the price of the equity may lose its value, and you may lose money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Another disadvantage is the currency risk. Like stocks, the value of international currencies fluctuates according to various macroeconomic and market conditions. So if the Indian rupee appreciates in the global currency market, the value of your cross-border investment depreciates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Taxation</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Now look at the taxation and see if cross-border investing is the right choice for you. Around 25 percent of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is charged in India for the dividends you earn in international markets, particularly US. However, you can reclaim the tax as per your tax slab.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The taxation is different for individual stock investments. For example, if you sell your equity investments after 24 months, a Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG) of 20 percent is levied on the investment. But if you unload your investment before 24 months, the sale is taxed per your income tax slab.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">If an investor holds a mutual fund that invests more than 65 percent of the Assets Under Management (AUM) in international stocks, they need to keep it for more than three years to meet the LTCG criterion. On the other hand, if it has been sold before three years, it comes under short-term capital gains and is taxed per the investor&rsquo;s income tax slab.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>A Few More Points to Remember</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Apart from all the factors and considerations mentioned above, you may take note of a few more essential points before embarking on cross-border investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Economic Conditions: The economic conditions of the country you choose to make investment matter. You must check whether the economy is flexible for new business models or willing to adapt to new innovations. A rigid economy hampers the growth of your investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Political Scenarios: The attitude of a country&rsquo;s citizens &ndash; the attitude towards foreign companies, products, and citizens &ndash; is an essential factor. For instance, citizens of nations ruled by foreign powers are wary of anything foreign and inclined to ward off any foreign investment in their country. Instead, they want to promote local products and services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Regulations: The business laws vary from country to country. The countries with lesser legal formalities for businesses are favorable for investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Society and Culture: Every Country has different social and cultural elements. These elements influence people&rsquo;s reactions to a new product or business. A proper understanding of these factors gives the idea of whether the investment will work or not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The Market Potential: The market potential can be evaluated in terms of expected revenues, accessibility, competition, and industrial dynamics in the prospective market. A large market with a rapid rate of growth, lesser competition, and stability justifies an extensive capital infusion in that market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The Strength of the Company: Finally, a company&rsquo;s resources and capabilities should be thoroughly audited before cross-border investing. The company should possess clear competitive advantages such as in-depth market knowledge, the latest technology, innovative products, and reliable partners. Otherwise, the company may face colossal failure in international and domestic markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687847644/jxusckfeos7xzl5yzghx.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What is Cross-Border Investing?","seo_keywords":"What is Cross-Border Investing?","seo_description":"All these wealth protection and appreciation features have been packed in investments in the US, European and Australian markets.

It is surprising, considering India is one of the largest bond markets among emerging-market economies, with more than $800 billion in outstanding debt.&nbsp;Last year it included China yuan-denominated debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Expectations were that India&rsquo;s weight would be at 10%, the maximum for a country in the index, resulting in the potential inflows of $30 billion from the move. However, getting included in these indices that financial firms or index holders manage is not easy. There is a strict criterion that has to be met.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Reserve Bank of India has taken steps to alleviate some concerns. It introduced a fully accessible route (FAR) in 2020, under which foreign investors and institutions can invest in Indian bonds without restrictions and investment caps. However, with the recent announcement, JP Morgan dashed hopes of inclusion, citing a heavy regulatory compliance burden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On 30th September, Adani Enterprises replaced Shree Cement in Nifty 50, following its semi-annual review. Several other key indices have been rebalanced, including Nifty Next 50 or Junior Nifty, Nifty Bank, Nifty 500, Nifty 200, and Nifty 100.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The indices&rsquo; rebalancing happens twice in one year &ndash; in January and July based on multiple criteria, including market capitalization and liquidity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Adani Total Gas, Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics, IRCTC, Mphasis, Samvardhana Motherson International, and Shree Cements will be the new entrants of the Nifty Next 50. At the same time, Adani Enterprises, Jubilant Foodworks, Lupin, MindTree,&nbsp; PNB, SAIL, and Zydus Lifesciences will be removed from the index.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is easily observable that the entrant stocks witness massive fund inflows and the ones replaced see net outflows. However, it is worth noting that there is no change in the fundamentals per se to drive the prices of stocks to be included. More often than not, the premiums are temporary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Then, what explains this price response, and what are its implications?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First, from the theoretical point of view, such a price response violates the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).

Many large institutional investors track indexes. Once a stock is known to be added to the index, it is argued that demand will increase dramatically&mdash;and the share price&mdash;as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is also valid for active funds and shareholders, who base their decisions on market capitalization. Taking a cue from this phenomenon, one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion and vice versa for exclusions, accompanied by changes in volume.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Index inclusion or exclusion announcements typically contain information that changes the public&rsquo;s perception of the stock&rsquo;s investment appeal. Investors perceive index inclusion to indicate lower risk and hidden positive details on management quality, longevity, or company health, increasing its future expected performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inclusion in the index raises investor expectations about increased liquidity of the stock, making it less risky to invest in it. Secondly, stocks that are part of an index receive greater investor interest and advanced monitoring, raising the stock price. These explanations align with the Information Signalling Hypothesis and the Liquidity Hypothesis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Though NIFTY 50, NIFTY 100, and NIFTY Next 50 are all large-cap indices, they are pretty different in how they have been constructed. It is better to understand them better to make informed investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">NIFTY 100 index is a basket of India&rsquo;s 100 large-cap companies in total market capitalization (including shares held by the promoters and the ones freely available to trade), with Financial Services, IT, and Consumer Goods dominating it. While rebalancing, emerging stocks with increased market cap automatically replace poor-performing companies whose stock prices dropped significantly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nifty 100 is subdivided into Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50. For a Nifty 50 constituent, the challenge will be presented by the constituent stocks of Next 50. Similarly, for the Next 50, the Nifty Midcap 100 stocks in NSE 200 would be the challengers. Unicorns in India would act as challengers to these Nifty Midcap 100 stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One can see a similar trend in the US: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (FAANG) overshadow the previous giants, General Electric (GE), Pfizer, ExxonMobil, etc., in S&amp;P 500.

But the case differs when we take up stock market investments. We are ready to take frequent risks in equity investments. We stick to these long-term stock market investments even if we lose money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, owing to the diversity of equities in a Mutual Fund&rsquo;s Assets Under Management (AUM), it has a lower relative risk than equity investments. This is because the fund managers invest money in various companies per the mutual fund&rsquo;s investment goals. So, even if a few stocks do not perform well, they have little impact on the portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This reduced investment risk is the result of diversification. Moreover, it gives the leeway for the investors to follow an &lsquo;invest and forget&rsquo; attitude with mutual funds. On top of that, they believe that the responsibility of capital allocation rests on the fund manager&rsquo;s shoulder and doesn&rsquo;t require any effort from their side.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Risks involved in Mutual Funds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Mutual fund investors have two significant concerns. First, whether they can attain adequate capital gains without losing their principal. Second, the credibility of the mutual fund company. The Securities Exchange Bureau of India (SEBI) and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) will address the latter concern. These government organizations oversee and supervise every domestically operated mutual fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here is a list of factors that could help you deal with the former concern regarding mutual fund investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. The Market Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The money invested in an equity-based mutual fund goes into publicly-traded companies&rsquo; shares. As a result, equity-based mutual funds, or any mutual fund having partial holdings in equities, are exposed to the volatility of stock markets. Volatility refers to the frequent price fluctuations in the stock markets owing to various international and domestic factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Credit Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All debt-based mutual funds that invest in fixed-income debt instruments like debentures and bonds are exposed to credit risk. In the case of these securities, the government and public companies are borrowers, and the mutual fund is the lender. So, the borrower must commit to return the principal and interest within the maturity period of the debt. If it doesn&rsquo;t happen, every investor in the mutual fund should suffer a loss of capital.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Interest Rate Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bonds are traded in the markets in the same way as stocks. Their price fluctuates with the change in interest rates and other economic conditions. Despite this volatility, they offer steady returns as interest payments. Every debt fund carries interest rate risk as the relationship between bond prices and the interest rates are inversely proportional. When the interest rates (the cost of borrowing) go up, the debt funds become less attractive and vice-versa.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Inflation Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation refers to an increase in prices owing to a fall in a country&rsquo;s currency value. Inflation risk is simple logic that with the decrease in the value of a currency, investors&rsquo; purchasing power also comes down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Few Key Metrics for Evaluating A Mutual Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There is no such thing as a safe, risk-free investment. By the way, the risk is only one of the few things an investor should look out for in mutual funds. We have already discussed the risk factors associated with mutual funds. Let&rsquo;s go through some factors that can help investors decide whether a specific mutual fund fits their investment objectives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Returns</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A well-managed mutual fund may produce a return that beats the return of typical financial vehicles such as Fixed Deposits (FDs) or Recurring Deposits (RDs). The prime aim of a mutual fund is to generate significant returns from the securities markets. An investor must look for an average annual return of 12%. The funds invested in specific sectors may perform better or worse than the market. So, check the industry or index your mutual fund of choice has invested in to gauge its estimated returns before investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Uncertainty</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Uncertainty and unpredictability accompany every investment opportunity. Therefore, mutual fund investments that employ a systematic investment strategy are always relatively safer. But what might happen when an investor, for whatever reason, couldn&rsquo;t contribute to his mutual fund? Does the mutual fund forfeit or nullify his deposits? Never. Mutual fund investors can suspend their payments until they can resume them. The conditions and the period of suspension vary as per the policy of the fund management company.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This ability to deal with uncertainty makes mutual funds a better investment option than FDs or RDs. The bank deposits usually get terminated in case of default in payment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Liquidity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Suppose you have contributed to a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) mutual fund for 10 years and have reaped substantial returns. Now, you desire to send your children abroad for higher studies. Unfortunately, an education loan with an interest rate as high as 12 percent would burn a deep hole in your pocket.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A liquid mutual fund helps you deal with this scenario without taking a loan. All you have to do is to liquidate the mutual fund and utilize the capital gains to pay for your children&rsquo;s education.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Tax Benefits</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Mutual funds are tax efficient relative to other investment instruments as long, and short-term returns are taxed differently. So, investors should hold their investments for appropriate periods to save on tax. Moreover, some mutual funds, such as Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), are specifically designed for tax benefits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">No matter the instrument, investing is always a game of risk. Therefore, taking any investment vehicle, including mutual funds, as &lsquo;risk-free&rsquo; could be fatal to anyone&rsquo;s portfolio. For example, equity-based mutual funds give you greater returns but have higher risks. You can choose those investments if you have a higher risk appetite. On the contrary, if you have a low-risk appetite, go for debt-based mutual funds. They come with lower risk only to give you lower returns. If you need the good in both worlds, try hybrid mutual funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687848602/yeyqughjay22xfsq8mmh.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Is Mutual Fund a Risk-Free Investment?","seo_keywords":"Is Mutual Fund a Risk-Free Investment?","seo_description":"We invest in gold, real estate, and insurance without thinking about their poor returns or the loss of our principal.

It has affected us not only physically and mentally but also financially. Numerous life lessons (and financial lessons) had rained down on us in those years. It has changed our attitude towards money and savings. Today, as the economy recovers, the relevance of financial literacy has been reverberating in every corner of the world. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">By the way, what is financial literacy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial literacy is understanding basic economic concepts and using various financial skills, such as personal finance management, budgeting, and investing. In other words, financial literacy is an ongoing journey of financial learning that solidifies your relationship with money. In addition, being financially literate helps you with financial, retirement, and tax planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Ways to Attain Financial Security</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The ultimate goal of financial literacy is to turn yourself into a financially independent individual and create a financially secure future for yourself. There are five significant ways to do that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Put Your Money to Work</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t find a way to make your money work while you sleep, you will work until you die.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;&ndash; Warren Buffet</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With every passing year, the purchasing power of money comes down with a rising standard of living. So, a single income source is not enough to survive. We are accustomed to living from paycheck to paycheck even while our needs and lifestyle change endlessly. As a result, we fail to use our money optimally, and our financial liabilities exceed our limits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial literacy will make you understand the power of compounding and how your money will work for you to make you more money. It enables us to invest money rather than save it as idle money in our bank account. Investing eliminates our financial liabilities and, at the same time, aids our retirement planning, setting up an emergency fund, and attaining our short-term and long-term financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing regularly is the key to putting your money to work. First, keep track of your monthly spending by calculating your fixed and variable expenses. Then set aside some money for investing regularly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The modern financial world offers various investment instruments like mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrency, private equity, and many more. Investing in a wide array of financial products diversifies your portfolio and minimizes your risk. However, you should also remember that in the world of investing, with higher risk comes higher returns. So, play the game as per your risk appetite.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you can set aside some amount monthly, you can choose a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) for investing. A typical SIP works like this: suppose your monthly revenue is ₹50,000, and you decide to invest 20% of it. That is ₹10,000 through SIP. The exact amount will get deducted automatically from your bank on the same day of every month. Your monthly installments will get invested regularly under the supervision of a certified financial professional. SIPs come with a small management fee, better liquidity, and higher returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Understanding Yourself</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some people, by nature, are risk takers, while most prefer to stay inside their comfort zones. These personality traits can be seen in investors as well. Some investors take higher risks for higher returns, while others prefer lower returns with lower risk and capital protection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When you take your first step into investing, you should be aware of your personality, whether low-risk or high-risk. Factors like age and the amount you can risk influence your personality and risk profile. For example, someone close to retirement usually looks for a steady income through low-risk debt instruments. Whereas a youngster at the early stage of his career prefers to take more risk and attain higher returns by trading stock derivatives</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Never Put All Eggs in One Basket</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Diversity is the key to an optimal portfolio. If one can accurately invest in the right mix of asset classes and investment products that suit their risk appetite and market conditions, they can minimize risk and maximize returns. A financial advisor or a portfolio manager can help an investor to do this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, the relationship between equity and gold is inversely proportional. A price fall in the equity markets drives up the gold prices and vice versa. This relationship helps an investor to hedge their investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Develop Financial Awareness</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fast-paced technological advancements have transformed the face of financial crime today. Besides banking fraud, digital swindling activities like spam, identity and data theft, fraudulent crypto assets, and online investments have become very common. Digital swindlers come up with many money-making ideas that promise to double your investment in a few days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial awareness is a skill that everyone should develop today. However, one must never forget that equity, commodity, or crypto markets are volatile and don&rsquo;t offer steady returns on your investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Look Out for Tax Benefits</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian government offers tax benefits for every tax-paying citizen. The most common example is the tax benefits under section 80C, in which one can claim a deduction of ₹1.5 lakhs on certain types of investments. Like 80C, numerous tax-saving methods exist, and one must avail of all possible tax benefits to divert these funds to profitable investment ventures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Final Notes</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Learning is a non-stop activity. Keep these five ways as ageless seeds of wisdom throughout your lifelong financial literacy journey. In conclusion, it would be insightful to quote Travis Cook, the Education Specialist at the Utah State Board of Education: &ldquo;My hope is that with increased financial capability, more of us will be able to transition from surviving to thriving. This results in sufficient resources to support our ever-changing, highly subjective pursuit of happiness.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Krishika Makhija</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687848835/glii9klbca5cztzzl57u.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Supremacy of Financial Literacy","seo_keywords":"The Supremacy of Financial Literacy","seo_description":"The CoVID-19 pandemic has taken two years from our lives.

A good investment can save us from burdensome debt and puts more money into our pockets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To make the money work for us, we must possess a good understanding of the market and hands-on experience in investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But where do we start?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We should start from the basic idea of assets and liabilities &ndash; the two elements that form the foundation of any business or investment. A clear understanding of assets and liabilities helps you build your life from scratch. We can find assets and liabilities in our daily lives, and a healthy balance between these factors can be a lifeline.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, read more about these essential finance concepts and their impact on your business and personal life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">What are Assets?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Assets are income-generating resources in your life or business. The value of assets also appreciates with each passing year. These resources increase your company&rsquo;s revenue by ensuring a steady cash flow. Therefore, assets act as a solution for debt, influence our net worth, and enhance a company&rsquo;s equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, suppose you lend money at a specific interest rate to someone to start a restaurant. In this case, the money you lent is an asset since you get the principal and the monthly interest in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To better understand how an asset is antithetical to a liability, remember the quote of Robert Kiyosaki, an American entrepreneur and a best-selling author &ndash; &lsquo;Assets put money in your pocket, and liabilities take money away from your pocket.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are five major types of assets:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Current Assets: The assets easily converted into cash within a year are called current assets. Cash and advance tax payments are examples.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fixed Assets: The assets that can&rsquo;t be easily converted into cash are called fixed assets. Real estate and machinery are examples.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tangible Assets: Simply put, physical assets like tools, machinery, and inventory are tangible assets.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Intangible Assets: Non-physical assets like logos, trademarks, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are intangible assets.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Deferred Tax Assets: The expenses such as tax overpayment and business expenses bring down a company&rsquo;s taxable income. It is because these expenses turn into a discount in the future as tax relief.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Impact of Assets and Liabilities on Your Finances</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Assets and liabilities have a direct and indirect impact on your finances. Sometimes, the effect can go beyond our imagination. So let&rsquo;s look at some of the ways we can gauge the impact of these crucial financial elements in our lives and businesses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Cash Flow</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The cash flow of a business means its income and expenses. It is measured using a cash flow statement. So, the cash flow statement reveals your company&rsquo;s equity. For example, the more assets you have, your company valuation would be higher. It can raise your company&rsquo;s share value while excess liabilities bring down your company&rsquo;s share prices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Business Balance Sheet</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A business balance sheet is an enterprise-level personal cash flow statement. But the business balance sheet shortens the calculation to a specific period. Usually, this statement has only the assets and liabilities of an enterprise. The balance sheet calculates the company&rsquo;s net worth by subtracting the liabilities from assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This calculation helps to identify a business&rsquo; financial condition. For example, when liabilities exceed assets, a company has to make more payments than income and vice versa. So, a business balance sheet helps you to formulate the right financial plan for your enterprise.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Understanding Your Investments</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are bad and good investments. We all have tried our hands at both of them. Unfortunately, while we are proud of our good investments, we are guilty of making bad ones every now and then. However, the quality that sets the best apart from the rest is their understanding of their bad investments and not repeating the same mistakes ever again. In addition, learning how assets and liabilities impact our finances can help us attain our financial goals without much struggle.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. Net Worth</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, net worth is the difference between assets and liabilities. It helps us to understand whether an enterprise is in profit or loss. Moreover, a slight change in the levels of assets and liabilities quickly impacts an enterprise&rsquo;s net worth. So, you must go through your enterprise&rsquo;s balance sheet often, and in case your enterprise does not show a positive net worth, you must adjust the expenditure towards the side of assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Bottom Line</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You can&rsquo;t find an equilibrium of assets and liabilities in anyone&rsquo;s life or business. However, keeping track of income and expenses can save you tons of money and time from debts and worries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Warren Buffet, a billionaire investor, once said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know how to earn money during your sleep, you have to work until you die.&rdquo; He meant that you should build as many assets as possible that could create more passive income for your financial freedom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There is also another meaning to that quote. If you better understand spending money on short-term pleasure without debt woes, you can save the money in your wallet&ndash; or even add money to it!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687849090/ijtpwhie6zfpp4yyghv9.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Assets vs. Liabilities: Analysing your Balance Sheet","seo_keywords":"Assets vs. Liabilities: Analysing your Balance Sheet","seo_description":"While growing up, we all would have terribly managed our pocket money.

Nouriel Roubini warns of a prolonged ugly recession, increasing investors&rsquo; worry. He is the economist who correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis. But, most of his predictions have been wrong in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What does all of this hold for you as an investor?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Last week has been significant as the central banks globally have been active. Lending rates in the USA rose to the highest since the global financial crisis after the Fed rate hike on Wednesday. With this, a reduction in personal and corporate borrowing is expected, impacting economic growth in the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. The Central Bank of Japan tried to shore up the value of its currency on Thursday by buying yen and selling U.S. dollars for the first time in 24 years. The last intervention was done during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. India is in no different situation with RBI&rsquo;s hawkish monetary stance observed in the last MPC meeting. RBI is expected to hike the repo rate by 0.5% this week.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. &lsquo;Inverted yield curve&rsquo; is a harsh reality, with the yield for a 10-year U.S. government bond equal to 3.73%, while for a two-year bond, it was 4.24% as on 25 September 2022. The shape of the yield curve reflects the investor&rsquo;s expectations for a decline in long-term interest rates, implying increased uncertainty. Historically, the yield curve has inverted before the last five U.S. recessions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5. The impact of the U.S. economy has a ripple effect worldwide amidst the Russia Ukraine conflict. Though the prediction of recession has been correct in the past, no one can be sure of the exact crisis timeline.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">6. Remember, every asset class has its function in the portfolio!&nbsp;Diversification is important.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Equity is expected to show higher volatility. Indeed, equities carry a higher risk than bonds, but equity becomes cheap during a market downturn. Keep calm and keep an eye on adding more equity to your portfolio at an attractive valuation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Debt has a place inside the portfolio, more so for people wanting stable cash flows! And even more so in the rising interest rate case, as is the present situation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. The bond market offers an investor various alternatives, ranging from low-duration bonds to sovereign gold and government bonds. Not every bond trading in the market is risk-free. Some of the bonds carry substantial risk, and one should be able to distinguish based on analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. Getting the basics right is essential. Understand the concept of yield to maturity (YTM), Duration and Interest rate risk, Call risk and credit default risk, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5. Do not ignore the impact of rising interest rates on real estate as an asset class. As seen in the past, property prices tends to correct or goes through time correction whenever the interest rates go up. Higher interest rates make acquisition costs of the new assets more expensive if borrowings finance real estate expansions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">6. Don&rsquo;t forget the contingency fund to deal with highhanded economic uncertainties (including the pandemic exigencies), worth 10 &ndash; 12 months of living expenses or total income (though there is no one size fits all approach). Your emergency fund must comprise liquid assets like cash and short term debt funds, which will not only reduce financial stress but also shield you from assuming high-cost debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Keep watching the conventional and unconventional indicators of recession.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Mirror mirror on the wall, &hellip;.. is a recession indicator of all!!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nMs. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687849526/hkrk8lthsn8hvvca1slw.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Skyscrapers, Lipsticks, Men’s Underwear, and Interest Rates – What do they all have in common?","seo_keywords":"Skyscrapers, Lipsticks, Men’s Underwear, and Interest Rates – What do they all have in common?","seo_description":"Second, the sales figure of men’s underwear and lipsticks is under the radar for many like in previous years, courtesy of Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve Head.

When you read further, you will understand why he was right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Imagine you go to a car showroom to purchase your dream car, only to find yourself in an awkward situation. The dealer charged you only a few thousand rupees and gave you a ridiculous message: &ldquo;Hey, thanks for coming in. You can collect the engine and other essential accessories from us. But, sorry, we don&rsquo;t manufacture batteries. You can get it from Exide. The factory of Endurance can provide you with wheels and a braking system. You can get the steering wheel from Bosch and lights, including headlights, from Minda. I want to tell you that MRF will give you the latest model tires. The wiring system and mirrors can be procured from Motherson Sumi. The windshield is available at TVS motors, and Sony has the music system. JSW would help you with the body. After all, it is simply DIY!&rdquo; (DIY is the acronym for Do-It-Yourself)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Can you do it? Is it that simple? What stops you from building an automobile company if you are skilled enough in assembling motor parts?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you apply similar logic to the financial services industry, you will realize why a DIY model is challenging to replicate in your financial planning. But, as a matter of fact, that is the need of the hour. Read on to know why.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First, we should discuss what makes a DIY model essential in financial planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What Makes DIY Financial Planning Difficult?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From the analogy above, you would have learned that do-it-yourself never works in any field, let alone financial services. Well, here is why.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First, the scope is pretty narrow; there are minimal options. Many traditional investment advisors are specialized in just a handful of investment vehicles. So, naturally, they could recommend only a few investments or combinations of these few avenues within their grasp. For example, a stock trader recommends trading stocks; a mutual fund advisor helps you pick mutual funds, and an insurance agent will sell you insurance policies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Then comes investment biases and bad selling, a common occurrence in the financial services industry. For instance, if your savings bank has investment products, they will pitch them to you. The bank officials have targets. To meet those targets, they will, in one way or the other, recommend you these products. This is why you can&rsquo;t find the best financial planning solutions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now, let&rsquo;s keep aside the biases and bad selling of the financial dealers. Customers also have their share of investment biases and bad choices that could influence their financial decisions. Under these biases and wrong preferences, they pick up investment options that they &lsquo;feel&rsquo; appropriate but do not really suit them. Consequently, they seek help from traditional financial advisors who recommend a few investment avenues that fail to give adequate returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you sidestep these hurdles and look for financial advisors online, you will have to choose between price and quality. Investment advice from experienced financial advisors comes with a hefty price tag, costing around a lakh rupees per year. For a middle-class individual, it is not a feasible option.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If the financial service industry is infested with biased advisories and bad sellers, don&rsquo;t you think you should do your financial planning yourself? But what stops you then?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>DIY Financial Planning Doesn&rsquo;t Exist!</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Honestly speaking, unless you love playing with numbers, finance turns into a dull and complicated subject. Unfortunately, no single metric or a sure-shot formula could guide you in picking return-generating investment assets. Instead, financial planning involves thoroughly analyzing price charts, balance sheets, asset classes, and financial objectives, which is not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unsurprisingly, only a meager 3 to 4 percent of the Indian population invest in stock markets. But, the participation is relatively higher in other emerging and developed nations. It is not because Indians can&rsquo;t take risks. It is just because they don&rsquo;t feel so. If done after meticulous investment analysis and due diligence, stock investing can be highly rewarding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Other than the stock market, there are a good number of lucrative investment avenues that laymen aren&rsquo;t aware of. That&rsquo;s why they end up underinvesting or following unskilled financial advisors and losing money. Recent researches suggest that around 38% of Indian wealth has been invested in savings and Fixed Deposits (FDs), which hardly beat inflation in the last decade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The problem is not intelligence. In fact, India has some of the most brilliant brains in the world. The real issues are the availability and dissemination of information. Even if you fetch the right information from the piles of inadequate information, it is so fragmented that putting them together and making sense of it is not a layman&rsquo;s game.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Without a doubt, the internet is flooded with finance courses. But most of them are certification courses that fail to provide actionable insights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What Is the Solution?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A straightforward solution is combining a financial advisory service with a do-it-yourself investment platform.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, portfolio management or financial advisory services are transparent enough to share the investment activities they carry out with your money. In addition, most of them act as your &lsquo;personal&rsquo; financial planner, so you can work shoulder to shoulder with your financial advisor to grow your wealth. During the process, you can learn more about investing in a specific market, instrument, or certain macroeconomic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">DIY investment platforms are everywhere &ndash; most brokerages and banks offer them as web-based or mobile applications. These applications give you real-world information and a DIY financial planner that helps you achieve your financial objectives.

Innovative investment solutions took the place of traditional investment options, and these new investment avenues take into account the investor&rsquo;s risk-reward profile and help them to preserve and grow their wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These innovative investment options, entirely different from traditional investment solutions, are known as alternative investments. Some examples of alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity, art and antiques, derivatives contracts, and commodities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs are actively investing in a few emerging investment avenues, which are expected to remain the key investment themes in 2022. Some of the major ones include Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Market Linked Debentures (MLDs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), Pre-IPOs, and offshore investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)</strong>:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">AIFs are better investment avenues for HNIs as their performance is not correlated with traditional assets, allowing portfolio diversification and generating higher returns. AIFs requiring a larger capital corpus are typically handled by highly skilled fund managers who understand their clients&rsquo; investment goals very well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are three types of AIFs in India. Category One invests in early-stage initiatives, start-ups, social ventures, and infrastructure. At the same time, Category Three involves trading derivatives, long-short strategies, leveraged positions, and investing in unlisted or listed stocks. AIFs that fit into neither of these categories are labeled as Category Two AIFs. These privately held investments require a minimum capital of ₹1 crore.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Market Linked Debentures (MLD)</strong>:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">MLDs are financial instruments issued by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) linked to a specific market index such as NIFTY, commodity index, and government yield bonds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The current market conditions bring greater volatility to domestic equities. Since MLDs are passive investment vehicles, the investor gets indirect exposure to those investment avenues by eliminating their volatility. They also offer returns of specified equity or debt indices and instruments they are linked with. They also provide capital protection in some instances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Credit rating agencies are assigned the task of rating listed MLDs. In addition, they come with lower taxes and lower volatility when compared to other debt instruments. All these features make them a good fit for HNI portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The only risk associated with these investments is the possibility of default in principal repayment of the underlying debt instrument.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>REITs and INvITs</strong>:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Higher token prices and illiquidity have traditionally hampered real estate and infrastructure investments. Today, these investment avenues have changed, and investors can participate with little money on liquid real estate and infrastructure assets. Thanks to new investment avenues like Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT). The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recently cut the minimum investment amount to encourage widespread participation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The benefits of these new investment avenues are twofold: first, they allow investors to diversify their portfolios across liquid real estate and infrastructure assets along with regular cash flows. Second, these investment products enable organizations to monetize their real estate and infrastructure assets to many investors, achieving a win-win situation for both.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Pre-IPO:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The year 2021 witnessed swarms of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) entering the market and many successful listings multiplied investors&rsquo; wealth. Likewise, pre-IPO stocks, also known as unlisted shares, have recently aroused the interest of both retail and HNI investors. Unlisted shares, which are not traded on any recognized stock exchange, are frequently traded in the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unlisted shares give access to innovative companies more focused on technology and out-of-the-box business concepts. An investor can also purchase the stocks as per the size of his or her pocket. However, this may not be possible once the company announces its IPO, as there are chances for lower allocations and oversubscriptions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Global Macro:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Global macro strategies invest across international asset classes and markets. Global macro analysts take value investing and directional positions based primarily on broader macroeconomic analysis. They also employ computer models to evaluate and predict market movements while portfolio managers make investment decisions through discretionary strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>International Investments</strong>:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Indian HNIs have been attracted to international investments as they can diversify geographically through the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) route as a hedge against Indian rupee depreciation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">International investments are not directly linked with Indian markets and give an investment opportunity in various lesser volatile investment avenues. Investors can access international investments through feeder funds which invest in global investment products, or through other instruments like stocks, bonds, or structured products, which facilitate direct international investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some HNIs pick up international investments to immigrate and establish a financial base in another country.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Word of Caution</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every aspect of alternative investments is not rosy. These investments involve a high degree of risk and, at times, face illiquidity owing to restrictions on transfer and lack of a secondary market. In addition, there are chances of losing every penny or a substantial investment as these investment vehicles are highly leveraged, speculative, and volatile. Other major disadvantages of alternate investments include a lack of transparency, complex tax structures, lesser regulation, and higher fees. They also come with insufficient diversification, and if there is any diversification, it does not compensate for losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs are concerned about conserving their wealth and optimizing their portfolio more than ever before. However, tax implications on the international investment avenues vary from investor to investor. So, it is always better to consult a tax advisor in the alternate investment space.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although every investment avenue is dynamic, the underlying principle remains: an ideal portfolio has investments in different asset classes. It ensures lower volatility and meets investment objectives yet cash flow requirements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alternative investments never fit every investor. Given the unique risk-return profile and complex investment characteristics of alternative investments, they are more suitable for sophisticated HNIs. These sophisticated HNIs should also consider their investment time horizon, objectives, and risk appetite to withstand market volatility before allocating their hard-earned money to alternative investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687849911/bva3x3ws3zp2456jc2vo.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Notable Alternate Investment Opportunities for HNIs in 2022","seo_keywords":"Notable Alternate Investment Opportunities for HNIs in 2022","seo_description":"The global financial landscape has transformed in recent years, and so have the HNI investment strategies.

Bhagavad Gita is a descriptive scripture based on a profound conversation between Arjun and almighty Lord Krishna.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Via the holy Gita, Lord Krishna enlightened Arjun and all of us with small references and gifted us the most valuable life lessons. Interestingly, Srimad Bhagavad Gita has been taught at the BITS, Pilani, for several decades and in a few foreign universities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The participants of this elective course state that this paper gives them a better perception of the scheme of human life and nature. With this clarity of thought, decision-making is better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In those days, Krishna&rsquo;s wisdom, counsel, and clever strategies enabled Arjuna to emerge victoriously. Now it can help millions to overcome their anxieties and be a guiding light toward effective investment planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Having a goal is the most important investment objective. All actions, plans, and strategies must revolve around the set goals. Be it setting aside a corpus for child education, marriage, family vacation, retirement, or any other purpose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A goal-based investment approach helps you choose suitable instruments and ensures you have the required funds when needed. You must maintain a focused approach to your investment plan and work towards attaining your financial goals by creating a well-diversified, strategic, all-weather portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Suppose you intend to build a corpus for retirement; your portfolio needs equity exposure as it can potentially deliver inflation-indexed returns in the long run. Similarly, one can look to a liquid fund for building an emergency corpus, offering better returns than a bank savings account.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As Krishna said &ndash; never lose sight of your goals; there may be several distractions on your way to your plan. Have the power to slash all the distractions and market-related worries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One should always stay focused and invest for a stipulated time frame in the market to generate optimal returns. It is essential to remain patient during short-term volatility. At the same time, avoiding risky propositions and falling prey to herd mentality is equally crucial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One must never be stuck on one single strategy. Nothing is constant in this dynamic world. It is vital to evolve with the times and execute appropriate strategies. Changes in the economic or political landscape might turn a highly profitable company into losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To review, revise and rebalance an investment portfolio is paramount. Acknowledge and acquire new information to modify your investment strategies to suit the latest market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A robust investment portfolio must have a certain degree of flexibility between asset allocation, diversification, timeline adjustments, and the investment amount. With this, you can be assured that your financial plan will survive through the thick and thin volatile markets and macroeconomic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Never let emotions overpower rational thinking. Make a mental note of the words of Shri Krishna &ndash; desire obscures knowledge in the same way smoke covers the fire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To desire is innate to humans but should not significantly influence the investing decision. Never be too greedy or too fearful in the market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Lord Krishna guides Arjuna to think beyond emotions when facing his kin. For instance, emotional biases might play in when one has to eliminate a long-held underperforming investment. Ideally, redeeming or selling any security should be based on how it fits into your overall investment portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A bad investment, if ignored, makes achieving your financial goals much harder. Many investors do not realize that a few underperforming schemes could affect the overall portfolio. In such situations, an advisor, your Krishna, can show you to stick to rationality as much as possible and help you make decisions based on analysis rather than emotions or hot tips.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unsurprisingly, due diligence and research help avoid traps that evoke your greed to take over your investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember, as the financial guardian of the family, you are the charioteer like Krishna, making an informed financial decision and building a secure financial future. Like Krishna guided Arjun, your financial wisdom &ndash; own or acquired through your planner &ndash; would guide you through tumultuous times in the stock markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The market may seem overwhelming and complex if you are unfamiliar with investing. It can be tricky when you are new to it, facing a dilemma, and have mixed thoughts or during volatile market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nowadays, much information is readily available on various platforms. However, it is essential to filter the information or advice you receive. With the bull run emerged several fin-fluencers offering simplistic investment advice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moreover, with these influencers&rsquo; increasing popularity and reach, several companies are using them as marketing channels, raising issues of conflicts of interest. Interestingly, most of these so-called experts (on social media) operate in regulatory no man&rsquo;s land, with no rules governing them (like registered investment advisors or research analysts).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Together, these financial influencers have a follower count of approximately 12.9 million people, a considerable number in a country with limited financial literacy and retail participation in financial markets. As of March 2022, India had a total of 41 million unique investors in mutual funds and 89 million accounts.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So my dear readers, know what to look for and choose your &lsquo;<em>Krishna&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;wisely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Decide what advice is worthwhile and what is not. Popularity does not always equal success. Not every time; everything and every decision is about getting rich quickly. Significant rises will always catch the eye but getting returns slowly (while it may appear boring) also matters. Over time, it can transform your life. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the words of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, the big bull of the Indian market</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;If following Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was all it took to make money, a lot more people would be rich.

It is our emotional response to danger, threat, or something dreadful that could happen to us. As human beings, we fear something or the other in our lives. The fear factor may be different from person to person in accordance with their age and living standards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sometimes, your fear is a blessing for others who can make a living utilizing it. Think about lawyers, doctors, astrologers, and many other professionals who take advantage of your fear and make money out of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In investing, the financial loss would be a nightmare for any investor. The other investing fear factors include interest rate hikes to slow down the pace of inflation. In the past, rising interest rates also shoot up the chances for defaults.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fear of financial loss leads to fear of failing in accomplishing financial goals or Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) on investment opportunities. This fear will ultimately result in choosing the wrong investment strategies and chasing the wrong investment opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Government policies and actions also create short-term fear among investors. Sometimes, even the fear of changes in fiscal and monetary policies may impact investor sentiments, leading to purchasing or selling an investment at the wrong time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, pandemic-induced fear (we all have experienced it recently) also triggers fear of financial loss, among many other fears. The fear of war, like the Russo-Ukraine conflict, negatively affected the global economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Overcoming Greed and Fear</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Warren Buffet, a legendary value investor, is quoted as saying: &ldquo;To be successful in the stock market, be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Greed and fear are the most dominating human emotions in investing. However, we can overcome these emotions if we consider these measures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Create an Emergency Fund: An investor must keep three to six months of essential living expenses to meet contingencies. An emergency fund can keep greed and fear at bay while investing.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Educate yourself: Investing would be fatal without basic investor education and investing skills. This knowledge and skills can help you survive the ups and downs of the markets.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Set investment goals: Every journey has a destination. Similarly, investing should have goals to attain success.

Another piece in Business Standard states that Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) invested ₹22000 crores in Indian markets in August as inflation concerns softened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, all these reports do not answer anything beyond numbers. What is so special about inflation that the news channels cover it, economists discuss it, and political parties fight over it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation significantly influences each of us &ndash; our food, choices, jobs, and even our politics are affected by inflation. In layman&rsquo;s terms, inflation is an increase in prices, but there is much more to it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article will explain inflation, its factors, and some significant financial terms associated with it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What is Inflation?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As most know, inflation is an increase in the general price of goods and services in an economy. So, for example, if goods and services cost ₹100 today and cost ₹104 the following year, the economy has been experiencing a 4% inflation or 4% price rise of goods and services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How Is Inflation Calculated?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, there are two types of inflation: wholesale price index (WPI) and consumer price index (CPI). The former is the price of goods and services based on the prices charged by wholesale dealers. WPI data is released by the Ministry of Commerce. The latter was calculated based on the value paid by a consumer. Since CPI also considers the consumer&rsquo;s tax, it becomes a better indicator of inflation for the public. Moreover, CPI is also known as &lsquo;headline inflation&rsquo; because this inflation number occupies the headlines of our newspapers. The official CPI numbers are released by Central Statistical Office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, have you ever thought about what precisely the figure, say, 5% inflation means? Well, the prices of goods and services increased by 5%, but 5% of which price? This 5% increase is on the base year&rsquo;s price of the basket of goods and services. The year 2012 is the current base year in India. So, 5% inflation means if a basket of goods cost ₹100 in 2012, but it costs around ₹105 this year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Price Movers</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do you ever think about the factors that move the prices in an economy? The forces of demand and supply determine the prices of goods and services in an economy. If more consumers need a product or service, the supplier will increase the price for more profit. As a result, some consumers would pay a higher price for the products and services they need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conversely, if the supply of a product or service exceeds the demand, the supplier would reduce the price to attract more customers or boost the demand. In other words, if people find a product or service available in plenty, they would never pay more prices for it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many factors influence inflation. For example, increased income or cheap credit push up the demand because every person has money to buy the products and services they need. This is why the government cannot print banknotes without taking note of inflation, as it can end up in &lsquo;Demand-Pull Inflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Black marketing or unchecked exports transform supply dynamics in an economy. Hoarding brings down supply and pushes up the prices. If exports increase, Indian goods get out of the country, turning those goods expensive in India. This type of inflation is known as &lsquo;export-boom inflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, if imports increase, more goods will come to India, causing lower prices. This inflation usually happens in India, primarily for food products, known as &lsquo;imported inflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sometimes, owing to the above factors, production costs shoot up. For example, an increase in diesel price shoots up the transportation costs. In addition, paying more salaries or hiring better talent brings extra costs to the company. This also makes the final product expensive. Hence, such inflation is knowns as &lsquo;Cost-Push Inflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Measures of The Government to Counter Inflation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was established under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in June 2016. MPC is responsible for keeping inflation between 2% to 6% until 2021. In addition, a Price Stabilization Fund with a corpus of ₹500 crores has been created under the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer&rsquo;s Welfare (DAC &amp; FW). When the food products&rsquo; prices fall below a sustainable level, this fund is used to buy those goods. On the other hand, when prices rise beyond a level, they sell the goods so that prices may come down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Is 0% Inflation Possible?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation is inevitable. If inflation is too low, people do not have enough money to buy things they need, or the suppliers are not getting enough consumers. So, they have no option but to sell their goods at whatever price they get from the market. While an increase in prices is called &lsquo;inflation,&rsquo; the fall in prices is known as &lsquo;deflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A classical deflation scenario happened in September 2014 when food inflation reached 1.3%, and the farmers could not recover their cost of production.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There is another term called &lsquo;disinflation.&rsquo; This term describes a scenario when the inflation index falls below 0% and turns detrimental to the economy. Disinflation also means that there are no economic activity and people have no money in hand to buy anything.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Inflation Caused by Fiscal Policies</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Several fiscal policies induce inflation in our country. For example, an increase in tax rates causes &lsquo;tax inflation.&rsquo; Likewise, excessive credit is pumped into the economy and creates &lsquo;credit inflation.&rsquo; Sometimes, to repay the debt, the government risks printing more money. Since more money would come into the market, prices would rise. This is known as &lsquo;deficit-push inflation.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation dramatically influences our lives. Our awareness of this economic phenomenon can help us understand the price of the goods and services in our economy. In a democratic country like India, such information would allow citizens to keep track of government policies and hold leaders accountable for their decisions and actions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation exists in both developed and developing countries. Hence, you would not be able to purchase the same goods and services next year with the same amount of money you can spend on the same goods and services this year. One of the efficient ways to beat inflation is by investing your money rather than saving it. So, the returns on your investments should beat the inflation rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687851256/gsxj0ijdgxnfugqgyxl9.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Some Facts About Inflation and Its Repercussions","seo_keywords":"Some Facts About Inflation and Its Repercussions","seo_description":"According to a recent Economic Times report, India’s headline retail inflation is expected to decline below 6% by the end of this fiscal year.

The popular benchmark index Sensex has been a robust partner in the Indian economic growth all through its existence, starting from 100 points to touching over 60000 points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687852217/igt1inja1xliu7luvdo1.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 450px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sensex has helped investors make strong returns over the years with a CAGR of almost 16% since its inception. Though, not all has been hunky dory in this journey, there have been phases of tug of war between the bulls and the bears.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The index faced challenging times during 1991-1992 while the Indian economy was liberalized. During the period Sensex rose sharply helped by the infamous scam and soon after it all came tumbling down as the news broke about market manipulation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even, the decade of the 2000s was rocky. During the period of the Great Financial Crisis in 2007-08, Sensex tanked sharply on numerous occasions. However, the reversal after the crisis was also healthy. The index continued to face occasional turbulence in the years ahead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The next major crash was in 2020 owing to the covid-19 pandemic. It has been a case of &lsquo;sometimes sunshine, some rain&rsquo; for the Sensex &ndash; ample bright days to more than compensate for the gloomy days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The bouncing back from the lows of March 2020 to crossing the 60000 mark has been phenomenal. All in all, the prominence of Sensex and equity markets has grown over the years. The recent participation of domestic investors has aided the domestic market in staying relatively unfazed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to the digitization drive and greater awareness about the capital markets, there has been a sharp rise in the demat account holders in the recent years. The same is expected to continue in the coming decade as well, as India charters the path to lead the world economic growth. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687852245/qd4ozorioedowmmnjih6.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 1004px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per some credible estimates, India&rsquo;s GDP is likely go up sharply on a sustained and robust path towards being a $20 trillion economy by our 100th year of independence 2047 (in a scenario of approximate annual growth rate of about 7-8%).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This indicates towards a substantial shift in the world economic order towards India.

The selling spree that amounts to ₹1300 crore per day has reduced the FII stake in Nifty 500 to roughly 17%. Although FII withdrawal has reduced in July 2022, the real question remains: When will they return?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the big reasons for these enormous FII outflows was the United States Federal Reserve&rsquo;s (Fed) interest rate hike to tighten the monetary policy to curtail inflation. The interest rate stood at 1.2% in July 2021, and now it holds at 3.3%. This aggressive interest rate hike triggered a global recession fear among FIIs. Consequently, the smart money started flowing out of emerging countries, including India, and found refuge in US Bonds. In addition, the higher fuel cost triggered by the Ukraine war also added fuel to the fire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This enormous FII outflow is seemingly higher than during CoVID times and even during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. But to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the market hasn&rsquo;t fallen to the grave this time. This is because the massive FII outflow was compensated by Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) to a greater extent. DIIs have purchased equities worth around 3.68 lakh crores in the same period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thanks to the two major streams of inflows into the Indian markets. First, solid Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) payments, which on average have run around 13-14k crore per month, and second, 15% of Employees&rsquo; Provident Fund (EPF) contribution to Equities came to nearly 2700 crore per month. Supporting inflows have also occurred from direct equity purchases and National Pension Scheme (NPS). Companies that opted for NPS indirectly participate in a resilient Indian equity market powered by DIIs during these trying times.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If history has been taken as a guide to the future, it is highly expected that FIIs would eventually embrace the Indian economy as soon as it turns ripe for investing. However, FII inflows into Indian markets largely depend on global inflation rates and the Fed&rsquo;s liquidity tightening. Although commodity prices have come down sharply recently, how inflation behaves and how central banks react to it remains a question mark.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In case the US central bank changes its hawkish attitude to a more accommodative one on the interest rate hike, FII inflows would soon resume in the nearest future. The other determinant factor is the recession fears in the US economy. A recession in the world&rsquo;s largest economy wouldn&rsquo;t be a good signal for FIIs to invest in emerging countries like India. Last week, US Fed hiked its interest rate by 75 basis points, and so did India by 50 basis points. As long as such monetary tightening continues, FII outflow would also carry on, but at a slower pace.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When continuous FII outflow occurs in a market gripped with recession fears and reined by strict monetary measures, it is a matter of concern. But Alpha Research believes in a different philosophy: Worst times create ideal wealth. The key is to invest and wait with patience. The brighter side is that the froth of higher valuation in equity has already settled, making both US and Indian markets fairly valued. So it is the right time to invest for long-term wealth creation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687854296/wjok2zqjolu2gojihmej.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Awaiting the Majestic Return of the FIIs","seo_keywords":"Awaiting the Majestic Return of the FIIs","seo_description":"One of the big reasons for these enormous FII outflows was the United States Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate hike to tighten the monetary policy to curtail inflation.

Today, when the markets and economies have turned more liberal, opening up a wide variety of investment avenues, many of us are comfortable with risky investments. We also often ignore the need to conduct strategic realignment of our portfolios at regular intervals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Taking risks while young is acceptable as we have the time and energy to compensate for the financial damages. But when we approach retirement, it is the time to change the rules, sometimes, the game itself. We can&rsquo;t put our money into risky assets. More than that, a portfolio rebalance becomes necessary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here we list five reasons for the strategic rebalance of your portfolio to reduce investment risk when you come close to your retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Sharp market drawdowns could deplete your funds: As you cross the 60-year mark, your risk appetite decreases. More than that, a single sharp downtrend could wipe away a large portion of your fund if you held it in risky assets. So even the timeline may not support your efforts to rebuild your portfolio to its previous levels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Fund withdrawals should be systematic, not strategic: Post-retirement, your portfolio should support your household expenses. Therefore, you should make systematic fund withdrawals (not according to market conditions) from your portfolio to keep up with your lifestyle post-retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. You can&rsquo;t take financial stress: Financial stress is detrimental to your physical and mental health. So, it is always best to build and keep a safe portfolio during the age of fragile body and mind. It can reduce your stress levels and is crucial for healthy and peaceful retirement life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. Need for liquid emergency funds: With old age comes health issues and medical emergencies. Hence, you should build an emergency fund to pay these unforeseen medical expenses and hospital bills.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5. Trustworthy cash flow for stress-free old age: The portfolio you build using your hard-earned money during your young working years should create a dependable monthly cash flow that provides stress-free old age.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Challenges in Rebalancing Your Portfolio</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Three significant challenges are associated with rebalancing your portfolio when you approach retirement.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Making A Living Out of Your Portfolio Returns: Ideally, you need to build a portfolio that will provide you with a steady cash flow. This portfolio should also ensure that your fund does not erode during your lifetime.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, this is a very tough task, given that the returns and inflation rates wouldn&rsquo;t always be consistent, and your market ideas wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely up to the mark. Therefore, creating enough capital in your portfolio and making realistic market assumptions is essential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Evolving Markets: The markets and the macroeconomic conditions constantly evolve with unprecedented peaks and steep troughs. No portfolio protection measures like hedging and diversification may be helpful at certain times. Hence, a well-calibrated investing approach to portfolio management is required as you walk near your retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Evaluation of Your Retirement Lifestyle: This is one of the most significant aspects of your portfolio management when you approach retirement. It is tough to comprehend how you plan to lead your life 10, 20, or even 30 years down the line. So, you will be required to identify your expenses and revenue during your retirement period. The assets in your portfolio should be aligned accordingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Few Pointers for Asset Allocation When You Approach Retirement</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Reduce Equity Assets: When you approach retirement, you must strategically move your equity holdings into debt assets. Moreover, this transition of assets should be done over a longer timeframe. It may be unwise to move your equity assets in one go. Instead, you will have to carry out this activity in phases. Remember that the exits from equity holdings should be during an up-trending market.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Create Liquidity: The transition of equity funds to debt funds could serve as an emergency fund. Having liquid emergency funds has utmost significance during retirement. In addition, it would help you deal with medical emergencies during your retirement.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Safeguard Your Health and Life: When you age, health risks turn higher. During your young working years, you should take measures to hedge your life and health, such as health insurance which may cover your medical expenses during retirement. The sooner you get insurance, the waiting period will be over by the time you retire, and the benefits will be available when you need them most. It would also be wise to get life risk insurance early on in life, which offers coverage up to your maximum age.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article may guide you to rebalance your retirement portfolio so that it helps you lead peaceful golden years.

My fellows would agree that we grew up in a much simpler world than today &ndash; writing letters, reading books in paper form, writing essays in notebooks with pencils. Today&rsquo;s young generation lives in a complex, uncertain, and volatile world (at times depressing &ndash; thanks to the pandemic and the severe financial crisis). However, one need not rue but take a lesson and move on. The youth, 20-year-olds enjoy a long-term investment horizon, even in these periods of extreme volatility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here, I am tempted to offer some unsolicited advice to my younger self and help those who have just started their professional journey. Over the last decade or two, I have had my fair share of success and failure. Success has been thrilling, but I have learned from moments I was supposed to call failure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let me begin with an example of a bottle of water. A bottle of water at Amazon is Rs 80; when in a supermarket, it is worth Rs 20, and in a bar, it costs Rs 50. A good restaurant or hotel can price the bottle up to Rs 100. At an airport, one may be charged Rs 150. What do you think causes this price to fluctuate, irrespective of the same brand and quantity? The answer is PLACE, which accords a different value, giving a simple message. If you feel you are worth nothing and everyone brings you down, do not stay there; get up, find a new place, and appreciate your worth. Don&rsquo;t settle for less.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, when confused about your career, ask yourself: What do you enjoy doing? Pick a subject, an area that interests you. Once you understand the nuances, you can be the best by consistent hard work, maybe just one percent, better day after day. The tricky part of the above advice is not the hard work but the fact that several things kindle the spark inside us and catch our attention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&lsquo;FEAR&rsquo; stops most people in their tracks, even before they start. We are all fearful of some things and many things. But being fearful is not bad instead, it is necessary to save one from all the trouble. The hack is to acknowledge fear as a part of reality and then manage and control it. The idea is &ndash; to be fearful and then courageous. Once you overcome the enigma of fear, Tinker early in your career and do a few things that excite you, then gradually, you will gravitate towards number one. Though money is a powerful driver in the jobs we pursue, it should not be the highest purpose in our lives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let me share another story about a mouse in a grain pot. One day a mouse woke up and found himself in a grain pot. Initially, he was delighted, gorging, thanking God so he didn&rsquo;t have to run for food. As the days passed, he reached the bottom of the pot, and the initial happiness turned into suffocation. He felt trapped in the pot, where he was solely dependent on the grains left in the jar, on someone to refill it for sustenance, and had no freedom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let us understand the moral of the story in this context.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Pleasures in the short term can lead to long-term traps &ndash; Be frugal, and save money. My motivation was to have enough money to travel, have fun, and party like a rock star. Be a savvy shopper to get rich &ndash; Take advantage of sales</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Things that come easily or quickly can often result in long-term pain &ndash; Live within your means. Swap FOMO (Fear of missing out) with JOMO (Joy of missing out).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Being too comfortable is not always an ideal situation. Rise above average and move beyond average.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. Be it talent or money, it loses its value if you don&rsquo;t use something to its full potential. Change and uncertainty create opportunity. It is up to you to latch on. There are no shortcuts. NONE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5. Not taking the right action at the right time, you would be in no position to do anything. Act now!! If you realize some experts are better at managing money than you, outsource the investment decisions. Accept your limitation, and own a few index funds or mutual funds instead of individual stocks.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">6. Never depend and feel comfortable with just one source of income. Invest it in a low-cost mutual fund. It will pay off rich dividends. Start to build your net worth. I think that&rsquo;s possible for everybody. Diversify your income so you won&rsquo;t eat all your grains (that one source of income) someday and get trapped like the mouse. As an investor, acknowledge that one can never eliminate the risk of being wrong. The best bet is to diversify, ensuring that one wrong step does not wipe out my entire net worth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">7. And finally, be ready for future challenges and do not get trapped into a comfort zone without understanding its future implications. Be courageous &ndash; there are a lot of hardships you would face in investing. Never let go of ethics. Building your social fabric is paramount.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear young readers, you have my best wishes for all your future endeavors. Never stop learning. Never stop grinding. Invest in yourself. Upskill and enhance your ability and insights. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get you ahead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687855348/wncffxgmlsupjwwrjjvm.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Advice to my younger self !!","seo_keywords":"Advice to my younger self !!","seo_description":"We often celebrate accomplishments like having a master’s degree, no debt, job security, etc. Still, a feeling that life could have been better often lingers as we age.

The words sound painful, and they are dreadful topics as well. But, although economies run on the foundations of value creation and debt, those who had to shoulder the burden of debts know how it eats away one&rsquo;s financial resources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To understand the debt trap, we can look at the hypothetical situation of Mr. Sharath. He was thrilled when his first credit card arrived at his doorstep. The credit limit of his card was ₹1,00,000. He thought his monthly expenses would be covered by a fraction of this credit limit, and he had tons of money left to buy things he never could. These thoughts led him to go on a shopping spree by paying the Minimum Amount Due (MAD) every month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sharath&rsquo;s reckless spending continued for a few months, and the interest on the credit card payments kept accumulating. Sharath did not pay much heed to that, and little did he know how much would be the amount after interests.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After nearly six months, he was buried neck deep in debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sharath&rsquo;s story is hypothetical, but this happens to 50% of the credit card holders in our country. The debt trap cycle feeds on itself and grows bigger if the debtor does not do anything about it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article tries to educate you about this financial trap and shows you how to get out of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Understanding Debt Trap</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The debt trap is something similar to falling in love. It seems like an absurd analogy, but it will do justice to the topic. One never realizes when he or she is falling in love, and when one does, he or she is neck deep into it. One may try to get out of it upon realization, but by that time, it becomes challenging and painful to get out of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In a debt trap, you get stuck in a cycle in which you are burdened by debt with compound interest adding to it over time. You might be compelled to take other loans to repay the existing loan, ending up paying the interest on both loans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over time, this credit cycle spirals out of control until you fall short of your repayment capacity and get stuck with no way to escape.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Debt Trap Mechanism</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In short, a debt trap is a situation where you take new credits to service your existing debt obligations. In such a situation, your debt obligations exceed your repayment capacity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Look at the example of Mr. Sharma to get the concept clear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sharma&rsquo;s daughter dreamed of a lavish wedding beyond his financial resources. But yielding to his daughter&rsquo;s unswerving wish and demands, Sharma had to take a personal loan with a 13% interest rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unfortunately, after retirement, Sharma couldn&rsquo;t afford his expenses and the Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) of the loan with his meager pension. Soon he began to default on EMIs. The defaulted EMIs invited more interest, and his debt obligation kept compounding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When Sharma noticed the compound interest being added to his loan, he made a wrong decision: he borrowed money from his cousin at an 11% interest rate. So now, he is liable to pay the interests on two debt obligations for years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Few Major Triggers of Debt Trap</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here we point out some significant triggers or causes that could put one in a debt trap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You Can&rsquo;t Afford Your EMIs with 50% Of Your Income</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We are living in a consumer society influenced by advertisements and promotions. Today, the marketing of consumer products has reached new peaks. All these have led us to follow the trends and impulsively buy things we don&rsquo;t really need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This impulsive buying out of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) causes unnecessary expenses that stretch out of most of our budgets. People naturally rely on credit, such as personal loans, car loans, and home loans, to meet these expenses. This could add an EMI burden to the existing loans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You Spend Beyond 70% Of Your Income.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">No one can evade some monthly fixed expenses like rent, utility bills, fuel, and education fees. The ideal expenses to income ratio should not go beyond 50%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You Possess More Debts or Loans</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The home loan, car loan, and personal loan add up to your expenses. More loans mean more interest that ultimately leads to more financial burdens, which become difficult to manage along with monthly fixed payments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You Are Prone to Credit Card Debt</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If there were the worst form of debt, it would be credit card debt. This is because the interest rates of credit card debts are higher than personal loans. To make matters worse, if you start to default on credit card payments, you will get stuck in a vicious cycle of paying compound interest repeatedly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You Fail to Save And Invest</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Saving and investing money is a simple concept, not rocket science, for wealth building. However, if a significant portion of your revenue is spent on servicing debts and fixed expenses, there would be no money left to save and invest, leaving you with no option for building your wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Getting Out of Debt Trap</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now you understand what a debt trap is and the causes behind it. So here, let&rsquo;s find out some ways to get out of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Acceptance: Yes, you got yourself in a mess, and the very first positive thing you could do is to accept your situation. Denial never brings anything good to your life or finances. The longer your denial, the longer you restrict yourself from doing something about it.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Budgeting: Analyzing your revenue and expenses (in short, budgeting) never goes out of fashion. People without budgets or poor budgets are the only ones who struggle with financial distress. Everyone should also possess basic personal finance skills to manage their money better.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Boost your income: Our economy offers us several ways to earn some extra cash. For example, you could buy a house using a loan with a meager interest rate and then rent the property for an amount higher than your EMI.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Credit card balance transfer: You can transfer your credit card balance to another credit card of yours with a lower interest rate. However, it would only help when both interest rates have a huge difference.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Debt consolidation: It is one of the most efficient ways to get out of a debt trap. To consolidate your debts, you should take a loan with a meager interest rate and pay off as much as your existing debts. You consolidate your debts when you merge several debts into one so that you can ask for favorable repayment terms, lower interest rates, or lower EMI.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Get Professional Help: Everybody needs help at one point or another. However, once you have realized that you are trapped in a debt cycle, it is better to get help from a finance professional who can suggest several ways to get you out of it.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Pinch of Financial Advice</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Debts, loans, and credit are inevitable in financial planning and wealth building. There is no shame in seeking credit or loans. Always remember that poor financial planning and management bring financial distress or put you into a debt trap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Contrary to popular notions, you don&rsquo;t need to get into a debt trap to learn from it. Instead, you can learn from the experiences of others and try not to repeat the same mistakes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687856174/lqf2s0vbmu9t9bu2w3u1.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Understanding Debt Trap and How to Get Out of It","seo_keywords":"Understanding Debt Trap and How to Get Out of It","seo_description":"To understand the debt trap, we can look at the hypothetical situation of Mr. Sharath.

These thoughts led him to go on a shopping spree by paying the Minimum Amount Due (MAD) every month.","seo_blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687856171/nybryscybrvoyudhpl7b.webp","created_at":"Jun 27, 2023"},{"blog_id":"67","title":"With Looming Climate Change Threat Comes Better Investing Opportunities","slug":"with-looming-climate-change-threat-comes-better-investing-opportunities","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1659948515","published_date_view":"Aug 08, 2022","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For over two decades, global warming and climate change have been hot topics among international climate organizations, geopolitical discussions, and environmental activists.

Lower investment returns are the by-product of climate change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing constantly has a shade of uncertainty smeared on it. Climate change does nothing but darkens that shade. Climatic disasters and diseases bring chaos and unforeseen costs. For example, recovery from floods, heat waves, cyclones, viral infections, water scarcity, rising sea levels, and other climate-related hazards takes a heavy toll on economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Suppose proper measures have not been taken, our dependency on fossil fuels will not be reduced, or we procrastinate using green energy. In that case, various economic sectors will face a massive loss of around $35 trillion by 2070. This financial disaster would be worth 12.7% of India&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over the next 50 years, climate change will likely hit the top five industries: services, manufacturing, retail, tourism, construction, and transport. Currently, all these sectors cover 80% of India&rsquo;s GDP.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, it&rsquo;s not necessarily all doom and gloom. Indian regulators, including financial market regulators, have begun policymaking and implementing regulations to address climate change. Moreover, the climate change threat also offers better investment opportunities in the green energy sector: solar energy, wind energy, waste management, gasification, and electric automobiles, to name a few.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Neeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687855909/ef8uglm1lvhqgbtwi2a4.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"With Looming Climate Change Threat Comes Better Investing Opportunities","seo_keywords":"With Looming Climate Change Threat Comes Better Investing Opportunities","seo_description":"For over two decades, global warming and climate change have been hot topics among international climate organizations, geopolitical discussions, and environmental activists.

In truth, both statements are true. Investing is risky, and the profits or returns come from picking the right investment vehicle, be it stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. This article offers you a little help in choosing the right mutual fund, how to evaluate their performance, and makes you understand the relevance of financial planning before investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Financial Planning</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial planning is like planting a tree. You should pick up a good seed or sapling, suitable manure, good soil, climate, and other conditions. Likewise, financial planning is your first step toward attaining your financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Your mutual fund should align with your financial goals. For example, if you consider a mutual fund for retirement savings, then short-term funds never serve your purpose. But they would be an ideal choice if you are looking to invest for a short period, say, just 6 months.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Your financial objectives may include purchasing a new home or car, funding a family trip, or creating an emergency fund. First, you must create a list of these goals and categorize them based on the time frame: short-term (up to one year), Medium-term (up to five years), or long-term goals (beyond five years).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When it comes to mutual funds, you have to choose the right one that syncs with your risk profile and investment goals. So here we lay out some essential guidelines you can follow while you pick up a mutual fund as per your financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Key Evaluation Metrics of a Mutual Fund</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&bull; Expense Ratio</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Running a mutual fund comes with operating expenses such as 12B-1 fees, management fees, maintenance expenses, brokerage, entry load, and exit load.<br />\r\nThe expense ratio is the percentage of funds spent on these operating expenses. For instance, at an 0.5% expense ratio, 0.5% of the total assets of the fund management house will be used to cover all these expenses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In simpler terms, the expense ratio is something like a mutual fund&rsquo;s Annual Management Charges (AMC). It is usually deducted from the returns generated from the mutual fund. In case of a higher expense ratio, the deduction from the fund&rsquo;s total returns will be higher. The mathematical calculation of the expense ratio is given below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Expense ratio= Gross expenses / Gross Assets Under Management (AUM)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Therefore, the expense ratio has a significant role in the performance of a mutual fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Funds with a lower expense ratio perform better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&bull; Portfolio Turnover Ratio (PTR)</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fund managers buy and sell the assets in the fund according to their strategies. Portfolio Turnover Ratio or PTR defines the frequency of these transactions in a portfolio. In other words, PTR is the annual rate of replacement of the holdings in a portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A higher PTR indicates more transactions in a portfolio, and the fund manager is a trader. This will increase the overall expenses and reduce the returns of the fund. On the other hand, a lower PTR indicates the fund manager follows a buy-and-hold strategy. This brings down the overall expenses and increases the returns of the fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The mathematical calculation of PTR: Minimum number of assets bought and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">sold/Average number of net assets * 100.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Always pick funds with lower PTR for better returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&bull; Exit Load</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If an investor decides to redeem his money from the fund, the asset management company charges a fee or exit penalty. Hence, it is known as the exit load. Obviously, exit load is levied to discourage investors from pulling out their money from the fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, it is recommended that investors should look at the percentage of exit load before redeeming their investment from a fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&bull; Reputation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A mutual fund&rsquo;s performance largely depends on the reputation of the asset management company and the fund manager. Both of them should hold an exceptional past performance handling various market cycles. A review of a fund manager&rsquo;s track record will give you an idea about his or her expertise, strategy, and experience in the market. You can also compare the returns of your choice of fund with the returns of other funds managed by him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Below are the key factors that differentiate the best fund manager from the rest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&bull; The fund manager&rsquo;s consistency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&bull; His money and risk management strategies. His interviews and writings are a great source to derive these insights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&bull; Asset Under Management: Asset Under Management or AUM is the total value of assets such as cash, stocks, bonds, and real estate that an asset management company manages on behalf of its investors at a given time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From a business perspective, AUM acts as a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for an asset management company and is an excellent marketing tool. So, an investor should pick a mutual fund from an asset management company with a higher AUM.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A higher AUM makes the fund more liquid and gives an easy exit process for investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Investing Is an Art as well as a Science</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In this article, we have discussed only a few simple steps you should take before investing in a mutual fund. But, in real-world investing, there are a lot more things you should consider and learn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing (not savings) is your ticket to financial freedom. However, as investing is both a science and an art, the better your homework, and practice, the better would be your returns. The Internet offers several resources to help you do that. In the virtual world, you can learn everything from personal finance and investing to taxation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you run out of online resources, you can always get professional guidance from registered investment advisors.

In other words, the portfolio of a fund of funds contains different underlying portfolios of various investment funds. Therefore, the investor of a fund of funds is indirectly investing in bonds, stocks, and other types of assets. Simply put, FOFs usually invest in different hedge funds or mutual funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FOFs are typically classified as &lsquo;fettered&rsquo; or &lsquo;unfettered.&rsquo; The fettered FOFs invest in funds managed by their fund management company. In contrast, unfettered FOFs invest in funds from other fund management houses across different markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you think about investing your hard-earned money, a fund of funds is always a good choice. However, &ldquo;read all scheme-related documents before investing.&rdquo; This article walks you through some basic and essential facts about FOFs. It will also let you understand how your money can be invested in FOFs, the expected returns, and so on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How FoFs Operate?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A Fund of Funds is tailored to investors with different risk profiles and financial goals. As FOFs invest in various funds, investors can diversify their investments, mitigate their risk, and profit from them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, if an investor&rsquo;s primary goal is to attain higher returns, the fund of funds will invest in higher return generating mutual funds but with a higher risk. On the other hand, for an investor looking for a long-term investment with lesser risk and a steady return, the fund of funds chooses investment vehicles with lower yet stable returns, therefore with lower risk.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s look at some of the common fund of funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Asset Allocation Funds:</strong>&nbsp;Asset allocation funds invest in mutual funds across a wide range of asset classes. These assets can be stocks, commodities, precious metals, or debt instruments.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Gold Funds:</strong>&nbsp;This fund of funds invests in gold in several ways, including physical gold and Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs). They may also invest in the stocks of gold mining companies.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>International Fund of Funds:</strong>&nbsp;FoFs can be both domestic and international. International FoFs invest in the mutual funds that invest in the stocks and bonds of multinational corporations. It also invests in units of offshore mutual funds.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The domestic FoFs invest in the stocks and bonds of a specific country. It takes into consideration that the fund&rsquo;s investment objectives and risk profile of the investors match well with the primary goal of any fund: accumulating wealth over time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Multi-manager FoFs:</strong>&nbsp;A multi-manager fund is a portfolio that consists of multiple professionally managed funds.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Pros of Fund of Funds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">First of all, FoFs provide investors with professional expertise in wealth management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FOFs are a perfect fit for retail investors. It gives them better market exposure with minimal risk than directly investing in the stock market or even in individual funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Besides attracting retail investors with limited capital, FoFs also let them tap into diversified portfolios with various underlying assets. Unfortunately, many of these investment avenues are out of reach for an average retail investor. For example, a hedge fund requires a minimum of six-figure investments, a minimum net worth for investors, or both.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most FOFs require a formal assessment and validation procedure for the fund management house and their fund managers. Since fund management houses&rsquo; and fund managers&rsquo; backgrounds are checked, you can ascertain that your money is in good hands.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FoFs are tax-friendly. Capital Gains Tax is not applied to the fund of funds even if you rebalance your holdings to preserve a specific debt-to-equity ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FoFs are easy to invest in and track the wealth-building process. You got only one Net Asset Value (NAV) to follow and one portfolio to manage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Cons of Fund of Funds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, FoFs allow better diversification and lesser exposure to market volatility. But these advantages are hampered by higher money management fees of FoFs. Like most investment funds, an FoF comes with an annual operating expense, also known as the expense ratio. This includes management fees and operating costs. However, investors of FoFs have to pay the expense ratio of both the FoFs and their underlying funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s make the math clear. An FoF may charge an expense ratio of around 1% to invest in other funds that charge another 1% expense ratio. So, an FoF investor is paying a total of 2%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, there is no wonder that, after paying money management fees and taxes, the returns of FoFs may generally be lower than those of the funds managed by a single manager, even if the FoFs perform very well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another issue pops up as over-diversification. FoFs invest in several funds, each of which invests in various investment assets. Therefore, the FoFs may invest in the same securities and asset classes through multiple funds. As a result, the objective of diversification is hampered and results in over-diversification, which is harmful to wealth creation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Picking the best-performing fund managers and FoFs can be difficult, particularly when the FoFs are fettered.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Is Fund of Funds A Right Investment Choice for You?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now, you have learned what the fund of funds actually is. It is time to decide for yourself if FoFs fit your investment objectives. If you are a retail investor who prefers lesser investment risk, you might consider the FoFs. This is also a better investment choice for someone with little money to invest every month. Furthermore, individuals with a long-term investment horizon might also choose FoFs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As an investor, there are several things you should consider when you pick up FoFs. The concept of the Fund of Funds is to get the most out of a single yet diversified investment plan. Before making any investment decision, you must assess the pros and cons of a fund and be aware of your risk profile as an informed investor. Last but not least, you should choose a seasoned fund management house and learn about taxation and transaction procedures, among the others. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687857606/ywoi3qfkr934hd7zrpgh.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Almost Everything You Need to Know About Fund of Funds","seo_keywords":"Almost Everything You Need to Know About Fund of Funds","seo_description":"A Fund of Funds or FOF, also known as a multi-manager investment, is a pooled fund that invests in other types of investment funds.

Hence, it is predominantly the first investment choice of an Indian. There is nothing wrong with it, as gold is an appreciating asset with easy availability in a country like India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, the gold investing scenario has changed drastically over the past few years.

Adding to the investor woes, those who bought gold ornaments as assets receive negative returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fortunately, people who invested in gold via a different route, namely Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs, have not faced the same problem.

The Government of India introduced SGBs in 2015, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issues the bonds on the Government&rsquo;s behalf.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">SGBs are considered substitutes for physical gold in terms of investment. Investors can buy these bonds by paying the issue price, which can be redeemed on maturity. Investors will receive, apart from the interest, the ongoing market price of gold at the time of redemption.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How does A Sovereign Gold Bond Differ from Physical Gold?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s look at some prominent ways SGBs differ from physical gold as an investment vehicle.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If an investor purchases SGBs, he or she can redeem them for cash on maturity without worrying about storing the physical gold.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">SGBs offer a fixed rate of interest.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The value of SGB goes up along with the price appreciation of gold.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The minimum acceptable amount of investment in SGB is one gram of gold.

As a result, SGBs are the new age investment avenues packed with numerous benefits that physical gold cannot offer you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Consider these five key factors when choosing an RBI-backed SGB over physical gold.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>It Lets You Invest in Gold at a Lower Price</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The gold price is fixed in every part of India and is regulated by the IBJA (Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association). Therefore, even though everyone can purchase gold at the same price, a higher cost of making and branding will be added to the physical gold or gold ornaments. Whereas Sovereign Gold Bond comes with no making and branding costs. Thus, the price of an SGB is lower than physical gold for investment purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Get Two-Way Benefits</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Physical gold can only give you the gold&rsquo;s price appreciation profits. But, in the case of an SGB, you are open to two-way benefits. An SGB can give you returns in two ways: One, the price appreciation of gold itself, and two, the interest rate of the SGBs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You can keep the profits of the gold&rsquo;s price appreciation, but SGB&rsquo;s interest is taxable per the investor&rsquo;s income slab. But, if you sell the SGB after the lock-in period of eight years, your returns are exempt from the Capital Gains Tax (CGT). So, in a practical sense, physical gold is a sluggish investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>No Storage Woes</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gold is a precious metal that is prone to theft or mishandling. The sole responsibility to keep your gold safely out of all mishaps that may happen to your prized possession rests on your shoulders. Most people pay for private safety lockers at various financial institutions or houses to keep their gold safe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since an SGB is a digital asset, the only thing you should keep safely with yourself is a paper document. You don&rsquo;t need to worry even if you can&rsquo;t keep the paper document safely. In case of missing or misplacing your SGB documents, you can reach out to RBI and request a copy of the papers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Sovereign Guarantee</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, the RBI issues SGBs on behalf of the Indian Government. So, SGBs possess a sovereign guarantee on interest payment and principal repayment. In other words, the Government assures that you will get your returns while you hold the bonds and your principal on maturity without delay. The sovereign guarantee makes an SGB one of the safest gold-based investment instruments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>No Need to Worry About Gold&rsquo;s Purity</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The price of physical gold is based on its purity. It is also one of the major concerns when buying physical gold for ornamental or investment purposes. There is always a risk of purchasing gold with less purity, particularly those not hallmark certified. But for a digital asset like SGBs, investors do not face such problems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Summing Up</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor doesn&rsquo;t need a Demat account to buy digital gold, but if you got one, it makes receiving the returns on your investments easier. The gold units in an SGB are allotted as per the money invested. These gold units are usually credited to your Demat account. You can invest in SGBs using a physical or electronic certificate form if you do not have a Demat account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Undoubtedly, SGBs nurture your wealth if you add them to your portfolio. Several reputed financial houses provide SGBs in various sizes and shapes that fit your investment needs. The financial experts at these institutions will guide you in purchasing these bonds. Apart from the expert financial guidance and investment management services from these reputed financial houses, you should also do your homework before picking an investment like an SGB that fits your financial objectives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687857380/dumpcspbs3wmor9euhs5.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Sovereign Gold Bonds or Physical Gold?

And to curb the high inflation, the Fed was compelled to hike the interest rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Heated discussions are going on over whether the rising interest rates would lead to stagflation or recession and will the government roll out reflation or soft-landing measures to save the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article puts forward a few probable economic conditions and compares them to help an investor make wise investment decisions during these turbulent times.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Stagflation</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stagflation, a combination word for economic stagnation and inflation, is an economic condition with higher inflation, slower economic growth, and rising unemployment rates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It presents the government with a dilemma: any monetary policy or actions intended to bring down inflation may slip into stagnation, increase unemployment and lead to other economic issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In May, the Fed hiked the interest rate by 0.5% to bring down inflation. But contrary to the expectations, the inflation soared to 8.6% from 8.3%. Again, in June, the Fed aggressively hiked the interest rate by 0.75% with no positive outcomes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An aggressive interest rate hike may appear to be a soft-landing measure, but, in fact, it is not. Instead, it is just a tip of an iceberg called recession with high inflation; that is, stagflation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bond yields would rise in an economy moving through the stagflation phase, making equities less attractive as bears hold their grip on the stock market. However, since bond and stock prices fall, investors are presented with an excellent opportunity for long-term investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Recession</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Recessions are characterized by a sluggish economy, rising unemployment rates, falling retail sales, and corporate profits. However, recessions are an inevitable element of an economic cycle and are the regular rhythm of the expansion and contraction of an economy. In fact, we are accustomed to similar economic cycles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During an economic slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pumps liquidity via interest rate cuts to boost the economic activities solely based on demand and supply. And after economy expands, RBI hikes the interest rates to suck the liquidity from the system and let the steam out of the inflationary pressure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During the 2000 dot-com bubble and 2008 global subprime crisis, the government did the same to save the economy from slipping into recession. This has been the only way out from every historic financial crisis when the equity market would fall, but bond prices would rise.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But, this time, the situation is a little different, and the inflation data post-Corona pandemic makes all the difference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The inflation rate wasn&rsquo;t high during an earlier financial crisis like Dotcom or the subprime mortgage crisis. So, the government could easily tame it with an interest rate hike or cut. But, the high inflation during the post-pandemic era is compelling the government to an excessive interest rate hike. It may push our economy into a slump or terrible stagflation territory.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Two Overoptimistic Scenarios</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you believe in luck and hold high hopes for our economy, you can wish for reflation and a soft landing. The magic wand of reflation will bring a ceasefire to the Russo-Ukrainian war, restore the supply chain, lift the Zero CoVID policy, and boost global business activities. Then, all you could wish for is a stable inflation rate and a strong stock market rally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Soft landing is another optimistic scenario, which one can wish for. During a soft-landing attempt, government showcases a brilliant &lsquo;balancing act&rsquo; in economists&rsquo; terminology. The interest rate is slowly and carefully raised at appropriate times without letting the economy slip into recession.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As a result, a modest recovery in the equity market and gradual improvement in bond yields may happen. The bond prices may take a short-term beating, but higher accrual coupon rates would compensate for the fall of bond prices and improve the overall return on debt instruments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Best Investments Are Made During Worst Times</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite every economic recovery attempt by the government, there lays a bumpier road ahead for us. During a soft landing, chances are higher for the government to fail, creating tantrums in the economy, and tossing it into stagflation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Everything depends on the inflation rates&rsquo; up, down, and stable states. It determines which direction our economy ship will take in the sea of uncertainty. Anyway, whichever course it may take, investment opportunities are abundant at every corner. Remember that the best investments are made during the worst times. So you should be ready with the gun powder to fill your investing cannon and take the long shot at the right time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859108/yjuauzxjnw7mxcybvvms.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Some Probable Economic Scenarios that Demand Intelligent Investment Bets","seo_keywords":"Some Probable Economic Scenarios that Demand Intelligent Investment Bets","seo_description":"All these economic developments may appear to be standalone concerns, but from a macroeconomic point of view, all are very closely connected.","seo_blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859106/amjaebier6lif3jdco8n.webp","created_at":"Jun 27, 2023"},{"blog_id":"75","title":"The Globetrotting Green Investor!","slug":"the-globetrotting-green-investor","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1656268200","published_date_view":"Jun 27, 2022","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Come June, and it&rsquo;s vacation time. Ever since childhood, I have eagerly awaited the annual holiday with family and friends. The memories of which I still hold close to my heart.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Post covid (If it&rsquo;s over yet!!), travel has become special for people. And presently, we are seeing the second coming of &ldquo;revenge travel.&rdquo; These lavish vacays, taken to avenge canceled pandemic-era trips, are filling up airports, hotels, and attractions with people eager to spend. This phenomenon is significantly relieving for the tourism sector, which has witnessed tremendous losses due to imposed covid restrictions in the last two years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On this note, for all my globetrotting readers, I am sharing a few thoughts &ndash; dichotomous as they be!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Specifically, Airlines were the worst hit and are still not expected to rebound to pre-covid levels soon. The air cargo segment was not hurt, as online commerce spurred an increased demand for air delivery that&rsquo;s still strong. However, the business travel segment may never return to what it once was, as digital workspaces and video calls are eclipsing the need to fly to collaborate.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859268/pfbw8eo0z669txd7lsos.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 434px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But while you&rsquo;re sipping Dirty Shirleys (or a fabulous mocktail) or trying to win a lottery to hike in a national park, don&rsquo;t forget travel&rsquo;s impact on the environment. Aircraft emissions pre-pandemic accounted for up to 2.5 percent of all emissions worldwide. Cutting down on these emissions is necessary to reach net-zero goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some of this is in customers&rsquo; (our) hands: As travelers, we still prioritize price over sustainability. Young people, citing climate anxiety, are especially ready to pay that premium, i.e., a little more for carbon-neutral tickets. Others plan to travel less to keep their impact low&mdash;some even report &ldquo;flygskam&rdquo; or shame about flying. The rest of the work falls to the aviation industry for efforts such as investing in sustainable fuels or prototyping fuel-efficient aircraft. Here&rsquo;s hoping that the next few years see those efforts take off.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you set out to depart, abiding by virus safety measures, don&rsquo;t lose sight of your financial discipline/goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Set a realistic travel budget and have that money in advance. An idea that appeals to many is to maintain a dedicated separate account for the same, with automatic fund transfer in the form of SIP. An added bonus is that the necessities of daily life would not gobble up the vacation money and ensure that the&nbsp;Insta&nbsp;stories bring back fond memories rather than financial guilt.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Don&rsquo;t forget to buy travel insurance, which most people ignore, if not mandatory. Though it is the least alluring element of vacation planning, it is non-negotiable. It can be an expensive lesson to learn in case something unfortunate happens (Let&rsquo;s not forget what COVID-19 has taught us)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One may consider staying closer to home or taking a non-traditional vacation to avoid massive crowding and inflated prices. Rather than fret, treat this as an opportunity to rediscover your favorite local recreation spots. Eating out at local restaurants, day trips to museums, theme parks, and forest bathing may be the cure for your distress and claustrophobia.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We need to keep in mind that Corona Virus is still running the show for all of us, the severity may have gone down a little, but the risk persists. One should avoid making definite plans too far in the future. An extra effort to make reservations that are cancellable/ refundable or are easy to shift around is worthwhile.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Lastly, remember the actual week-long trip will fade away in memories in a flash. Planning and anticipating your trip rather than actually taking it may make you happier. At least, this is true as per the study published in the &lsquo;Journal of Applied Research in Quality of Life. Another study at Cornell University also reaches a similar conclusion- When we plan for a life experience like a big trip, it creates a lot of happiness.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859314/gdyacjuk39as9n3bxe0i.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 495px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So my dear readers, slow down and be patient. Let considerations of environmental impact be there in your mind while planning your holiday.

The average PE ratio from February 2006 to 30 April 2022 stands at 22.46. Currently, the P/E ratio stands at 20 and the forward P/E ratio at 18. Therefore, the market is now fairly valued, meaning it is neither cheaper nor expensive. During 2006-2017, the P/E ratio stood at 15 to 25, taking the market into fair value territory with average returns despite the 2008 global financial crisis, which wiped away the wealth of investors accumulated over the years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian investment scenario has changed drastically in recent years turning India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. With the spike in internet penetration, the growing youth population with a higher standard of living, the reduction in corporate tax, and ease of doing business are attracting Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) into the Indian markets. All these took the P/E ratio of Nifty 50 above 25 in 2018 and 2019.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since then, with the Corona pandemic outbreak, the subsequent digitization wave took the P/E ratio above 30. In 2021, it touched the 42 mark. This higher P/E valuation results from the CoVID pandemic and higher liquidity owing to the government&rsquo;s efforts to avoid markets slipping into a recession. The pandemic-induced sluggish economy generated increased savings, and the equity market flourished as it attracted retail investors like never before. More than one crore new Demat accounts have been opened in those days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, since companies are switching from working from home to hybrid or working from office models, hikes in compensation, salary cuts, reduction in interest rates, and layoffs reduce their profit margin. Moreover, on the macroeconomic front, supply chain disruptions due to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the Zero CoVID policy adversely affect economic and business performance, bringing the P/E ratio below 20.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nevertheless, the Indian corporate earnings and market fundamentals are solid. The government invests heavily in infrastructure, deploys schemes like Production Linked Incentives (PLI), and supports micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). In addition, the China Plus One policy and credit growth at the global level aid the growth prospect of the Indian economy and markets. All these initiatives and developments brought down one year forward P/E ratio to 18 and turned the Indian market more lucrative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859701/lrdz60ux6bxawfmmrmkc.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 238px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We should note that the P/E ratio and market returns are negatively correlated. Similarly, market returns and investment horizons are inversely proportional to each other. So, a higher P/E ratio and longer investment horizon will reduce the rate of returns on investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The table above shows examples of market returns and P/E ratio discrepancies. You can see that even if the P/E ratio is higher than 27 in an investment horizon of five years, we are holding a loss-making investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bhavna Gupta</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687859791/zxcw5wfczqfoc2dpb6yk.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Current P/E Ratio Analysis of Nifty 50","seo_keywords":"The Current P/E Ratio Analysis of Nifty 50","seo_description":"P/E Ratio stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, one of investors’ most commonly used stock valuation metrics.

Every day, this crypto market hits a new low. Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s most popular cryptocurrency, has dropped to $20,407, its lowest level in 18 months (June 15). This year so far, it has dropped by around 60%. Furthermore, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, plunged nearly 25% to $1,040.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The worldwide crypto market has decreased from $1.02 trillion to $983.72 billion,&nbsp;an 11% drop since Monday. Recently, all major cryptocurrencies have been performing in the red, putting long-term investors to the test. This article will go through all the factors that led to the massive crypto-market meltdown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Luna-Terra crash</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It all began following the Luna-Terra debacle, a major event that had far-reaching implications for its investors and the whole crypto industry. Before the catastrophe, several investors had their whole life savings invested in Terra currency, a stablecoin with a market capitalization of nearly $18 billion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stablecoins are designed to be valued the same as the US Dollar or some other fiat currency, and they exist largely so that cryptocurrency investors may quickly enter and exit the fiat currency without requiring the approval of a third party (in this example, a bank). Binance USD (BUSD), USD Coin (USDC), and Tether (USDT) are just a few examples of stablecoins on the markets. Three of the above stablecoins are pegged to the central bank&rsquo;s USD. These organizations have a treasury of dollars in the form of commercial papers/receivables or cash reserves that support each coin to one dollar.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With Luna dropping 99.9% of its worth, Terraform Labs (the firm behind Terra) devised a strategy to sell their entire Bitcoin holdings to restore the $1 peg. However, they ultimately failed to achieve. As a consequence, the crypto market lost more than $40 billion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Equity Market</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The crypto market is also tied to the stock market. If the stock market is experiencing a decline, the crypto-sphere is experiencing the same thing. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many of the same variables that drive stock values.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to data obtained from Investopedia, cryptocurrency prices increased and declined similarly to equities prices in late 2021 and then into mid-2022. Further, tech companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Apple have dropped more than 6%. This seems to have significant development in the stock market, and you can look forward to the same pattern in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, Musk&rsquo;s Dogecoin, and Bitcoin all fell below $23,000 on Monday, June 15, 2022.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A New York Times report found that Bitcoin&rsquo;s price fluctuations mirror those of Nasdaq, a stock index disproportionately skewed towards tech companies. Although cryptocurrency markets should operate independently of conventional markets, this has not always been the case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A rise in Interest Rates</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The US Federal Reserve agreed to raise interest rates to reduce inflation. The Fed will look for an aggressive plan to increase debt prices, restrain spending, and rein in record-high inflation, according to a Wall Street Journal article. An upcoming recession is frequently predicted by a sharp increase in interest rates. In India, income from the VDA transfers will be subject to a 30% income tax.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Following the statement, the cryptocurrency market and the equities markets both crashed. Investors lost faith and started selling their digital assets, which caused carnage in the cryptocurrency market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Celsius Network</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On Sunday, Celsius Network, a Decentralized Finance platform, said it would freeze all cryptocurrency transactions due to &ldquo;extreme market conditions.&rdquo; Following the closure, the market experienced a massive sell-off, with all cryptos plummeting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In a blog post, the corporation said that they are taking this essential measure to stabilize liquidity and operations while taking actions to protect and safeguard assets. In addition, as part of their commitment to their consumers, customers would continue to accrue points throughout the break.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Regulatory Difficulties</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The year 2022 did not seem kind to cryptocurrencies. Prior to making a comeback in February, the bitcoin market fell in January. Governments have scrutinized the global crypto industry throughout the globe as they attempt to regulate cryptos.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Russia&rsquo;s central bank recommended prohibiting the usage and mining of cryptocurrencies on the Russian territory in January 2022, citing concerns to economic stability, residents&rsquo; well-being, and the country&rsquo;s monetary policy autonomy as justifications. Regulatory difficulties have made it challenging for investors to decide whether or not to invest in cryptocurrency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">What should current crypto investors do in such a situation?</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If your cryptocurrency portfolio is down considerably, but you don&rsquo;t need the money, crypto enthusiasts advise holding. Don&rsquo;t fret about the present price drop. However, if you need money or are anxious, consider selling half of your portfolio to get cash and have a portion of your money invested in the present market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tips for first-time crypto investors</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do not invest a large sum in this cryptocurrency market crash. Instead, develop a framework similar to a systematic investment plan (SIP) to invest small weekly sums. With SIPs, you may average your purchase price, avoiding catastrophic losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Takeaway</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Avoid betting while investing in cryptocurrencies. Remember to record earnings often. Further, restrict your entire allocation to cryptocurrencies to 2% of your investment, particularly if you are inexperienced with the hyper-volatility of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687860064/cufa4f0y4ptnrgp4srsr.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Crypto Sheer Fall","seo_keywords":"Crypto Sheer Fall","seo_description":"In India, cryptocurrencies have evolved significantly from being referred to as speculative items to “virtual digital assets” (VDAs).

But where will the ETF market go in the future, and what patterns should investors be aware of?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): What Is It?</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are asset classes whose assets are invested in securities to match a benchmark, including a sector, index, or other assets. ETFs are similar to mutual funds because they offer investors broad exposure to equities. For instance, an investor may purchase a technology ETF to get exposure to several technology equities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ETFs are notable in that they may be exchanged on an exchange like stocks. In contrast to mutual funds, which have specific rules and limitations about selling, investors may purchase and sell ETFs at any time, just as they would with stocks. Also, the value of an ETF changes daily. In addition, ETFs are passive investments that follow a benchmark. So, their fee ratios are often lower than those of conventional investment funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even though ETFs were created in the 1990s and indexing as an investing method has existed for much longer, this investment option has recently received much attention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s check why ETFs are growing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Reasons Behind ETFs Growth</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. EFTs are simple and transparent</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ETFs are among the simplest investment vehicles for beginners. They trade on a marketplace like stocks. So, an investment in ETFs is as easy as going into your online trading account and picking the funds that best meet your requirements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Additionally, ETFs provide increased transparency than other investment instruments. Since ETFs strive to mimic indexes based on stated market rules, investors are aware of their funds&rsquo; holdings. And unlike conventional mutual funds, which report holdings quarterly, most ETFs reveal holdings daily, giving investors more regular glimpses of their assets and allowing them to comprehend potential dangers better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. ETFs Can Provide a Robust Portfolio Core</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While there is no &ldquo;correct&rdquo; method to construct a portfolio, ETFs may assist in establishing a solid foundation. ETFs invest in a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Thus, investors have access to nearly any asset class, sector, area, topic, and investing style cheaply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to their low cost, they assist investors in investing more of their hard-earned funds and perhaps attain their financial objectives sooner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. ETFs Can Aid in Capitalizing on Exciting Long-Term Trends</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ETFs provide a simple and concrete approach to participating in long-term trends reshaping our world. It eliminates the need to choose individual stock winners.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. ETF Providers Are Extremely Concentrated on Investors</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing may be frightening at times. But, with the appropriate ETF provider, investors can discover tools to help them accomplish their financial objectives and construct solid portfolios confidently. Seek ETF providers with a history of inventing and anticipating investor demands, a wealth of industry information, and a diverse product offering.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Are ETFs For Long-Term or Short-Term Funds?</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ETFs may be long- or short-term investments based on the investor&rsquo;s time horizon. As there are hundreds of ETFs from which to choose, you may choose one that corresponds to your financial profile. For instance, if you want to invest and retain long-term, you may select an ETF that predominantly invests in blue-chip companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If, on the other hand, you want to make a short-term investment with the expectation of rapid development, you may purchase an ETF that focuses on new businesses with strong growth potential soon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Will ETFs Fail?</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some ETFs fail because they cannot create sufficient assets to finance the company&rsquo;s operations or investments. Yet, ETFs usually are low-risk investment alternatives. Also, investors do not generally lose their capital when an ETF shuts down since many are shut down in an organized manner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ETFs will probably continue to be an appealing alternative for investors seeking to diversify their holdings without raising the time and effort required to manage their assets. ETFs are now enjoying tremendous growth. However, the long-term viability of ETFs is uncertain because evolving technologies are transforming the financial services sector.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687860266/wkiju8s7ybaoabegarfj.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"ETF Increasing Market Share","seo_keywords":"ETF Increasing Market Share","seo_description":"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are getting more popular due to their ease of use, cost-effective investment strategy, and diversification.

It goes up &amp; down in which investor should stay calm &amp; invested and should not let the emotions derail the financials decision. In the yoga, breathing play very vital role. Yogi master in breathing before learning any posture.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Educating oneself is required for both, without knowing about posture and its benefit yoga cannot be done. In investing, investor should know everything about the market and investment, otherwise it can go wrong. Both need instructor, Yogi needs yoga trainer vis-&agrave;-vis investor needs investment advisor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Yoga helps to quest for self-realization to avoid pain, unhappiness, criticism &amp; impatience, which are common ills of human. Similarly, investor seek right asset class at good valuation for investment which avoid losses &amp; defaults in the portfolios. Self-realisation helps in right decision about not timing the market but giving time to market for better results.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Holding the burn in maintaining the posture for several minutes in yoga teaches patience likewise in investing, holding the positions as per your goal or long term shows the patience in money life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In both it leads to flexibility, for Yogi, the body become flexible and for investor, decision making becomes flexible as per market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The principle of yoga is design to achieve the physical well-being and mental acuity. Similarly, investor need to follow the investment tenets to achieve the financial goals and stability in the money life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be yogi of investment!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Neeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687860402/l4mecgu8f3x1izw7jaqj.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Investing is like Yoga","seo_keywords":"Investing is like Yoga","seo_description":"We celebrate International Yoga Day every 21st of June.

You can find them as financiers, economists, and even wealth managers! In fact, they are proponents of the efficient market hypothesis, also known as efficient market theory.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Efficient Market Hypothesis</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is popular in financial economics. The theory states that stock prices reflect every piece of information, making the generation of alpha in investing nearly impossible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In other words, stocks always trade at their fair value and price on exchanges, and investors can&rsquo;t invest in undervalued stocks or sell overvalued stocks. So, it is impossible to &lsquo;beat&rsquo; the market using stock picking or market timing strategies. The only way for an investor to generate higher returns is by buying riskier investments or passive investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the flip side, opponents of EMH strongly believe that it is possible to beat the market as stocks can deviate from their fair market values and prices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sounds confusing, isn&rsquo;t it? If EMH is true, investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala or Warren Buffett wouldn&rsquo;t be successful in making their billions. If no one can beat the market, how could some people successfully use trading to generate profit? As per EMH, an ideal investing approach should be to invest in a long-term passive fund and forget about it, rather than wasting your time and intelligence on stock market research and stock picking.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although the theory is conflicting, the efficient market hypothesis has a popular following in financial economics. Here we discuss the relevance of this popular economic theory and look at how this theory can make an impact on current market conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Various Forms of Efficient Market Hypothesis</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to the efficient market theory, investors tend to act randomly and illogically. Therefore, the market is always &lsquo;right&rsquo; or &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; as a whole; &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; in a sense, &lsquo;normal.&rsquo; For example, if a crowd starts running in a particular direction, there arises a natural tendency to follow the group, even if there is no compelling reason to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are three primary forms of EMH, and they are described below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Weak Form</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The weak form of EMH suggests that every stock reflects past information. Therefore, fundamental and technical analysis of stocks may give you information (not valuable &lsquo;patterns&rsquo;) to achieve short-term returns that are higher than average market returns. In a plain sense, it means that neither fundamental nor technical analysis will give a long-term benefit for the investor, but they have a chance to generate returns in the short term.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Semi Strong Form</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to semi-strong EMH, neither fundamental nor technical analysis helps you &lsquo;beat&rsquo; the market. But with insider information, you can reap extraordinary gains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Strong Form</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the strong form of EMH, no extraordinary gains can be realized because all present and past information (even the insider information) is adjusted to the current stock price. As all information is known to every market player, no investor can reap better returns than average market returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although EMH claims that outperforming the market is nearly impossible, the theory claims that outliers can &lsquo;beat&rsquo; the market at some point. While some outliers lose tons of money in the market, most investors stand closer to the median. In short, the instances of beating the market are nothing short of sheer luck.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The practicality of the Efficient Market Hypothesis</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The proponents of the efficient market hypothesis are also proponents of passive investing as they do not believe in active investing. So, they believe in &lsquo;slow and steady wins the race&rsquo; and invest in passive index funds with a long-term perspective. This investment approach gives them only what the market has to offer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When market players increase, the market becomes more efficient as more players bring more information. This increase in data has a more significant impact on the stock prices. The entry of more market players makes markets more transparent. When markets evolve, becoming more active and liquid, it leads to the emergence of arbitragers who will correct minor price anomalies in the short run.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Can Markets be Inefficient?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now let&rsquo;s look at an inefficient market. While an efficient market feeds all the available information into the stock prices, inefficient markets fail to provide the information into the stock price although it has all the information.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some of the characteristics of inefficient markets are their non-transparent nature, higher transactional costs, and fewer market players. In addition, a few market players in an inefficient market possess an edge to easily beat the market and generate hefty returns. That also means a few traders or investors can easily fool most investors. Inefficient markets are volatile and not subject to proper regulation by a regulatory body like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The efficient market theory didn&rsquo;t gain popularity until the 1960s when the emergence of computers made it possible to quickly compare and calculate the prices of thousands of stocks. In 1945, Friedrich Hayek, an Austrian economist, argued that markets are the most effective way of aggregating the pieces of information dispersed among individuals in a society. Self-interested traders, on the other hand, may try to profit from private data. But, in doing so, they contribute to more efficient market prices as their trades reflect in the stock or market prices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Legendary investors such as Warren Buffett, George Soros, and several prominent researchers have disputed EMH both empirically and theoretically. Nevertheless, imperfections in financial markets exist, and behavioral economists attribute it to a combination of human cognitive biases like overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, and information bias, including several other predictable human errors in information processing and reasoning. These human psychological factors are researched by prominent economists like Richard Thaler and famous psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and Paul Slovic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Market efficiency is the quality that is needed for any developed economy. But unfortunately, financial markets may not give an opportunity to earn supernatural returns. Still, by use of portfolio management and risk profiling, a higher return than the average market returns can be attained.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687860812/lsdjdihwbgkyl0m9uhla.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Understanding Efficient Market Hypothesis","seo_keywords":"Understanding Efficient Market Hypothesis","seo_description":"Random walkers (people who argue price variations in financial markets are random) are everywhere.

When you asked your parents how much a kilo of rice cost while they were kids, they would answer that they could buy one or two kilos of rice with a ₹2 metal coin. Today, maybe, we can buy a kilo or two of rice with a ₹50 paper note or pay that price digitally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The prices of commodities and services increase over time. However, it is not because the service or the product&rsquo;s value is rising but because of the gradual erosion of our currency&rsquo;s value. One of the significant reasons is inflation, which is beyond this article&rsquo;s scope.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, have you ever wondered how the price of a single product or service has taken different shapes and sizes over the decades? For example, 25 paisa coins were small and round in shape. On the other hand, ₹2 metal coins are round but more oversized. And when it comes to ₹50, they are not circular metal coins but a rectangular piece of paper or a credit card swipe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here we discuss how currencies have evolved and exist as it is today. We also look at how a single paper piece can hold monetary value and what backs its value.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Fiat Currency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fiat currency is money with no intrinsic value but is accepted by a government as legal tender. Historically, paper currencies are backed by physical yet precious commodities like gold and silver, but the fiat currency hinges on the issuing government&rsquo;s trustworthiness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fiat currency was invented as a substitute for commodity and representational money. Commodity money gets its value from precious metals like gold and silver, whereas representative money is a claim on a monetary reserve or a commodity. On the other hand, the value of fiat currency is derived from its supply and demand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">China introduced the first fiat currency in the world around 1000 CE, and it spread across the globe in no time. Fiat currency gained worldwide prominence when US President Richard Nixon removed the gold standard in 1971. Most countries use fiat paper currencies with tight control over counterfeiting and money supply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Pros of Fiat Currency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fiat currency comes with several advantages, and a few prominent ones are mentioned below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Unlike commodity and representative money, which are volatile due to the business cycles and price fluctuations of underlying assets, fiat currency has a consistent value. As a result, a country&rsquo;s central bank can produce or keep paper money as per the need of their economy, giving them complete control over the money supply, interest rates, and liquidity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. Fiat currency is a highly valued and widely accepted cash all over the globe as it is received by various currency exchanges and payment networks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Since governments have complete control over the fiat money supply and are not based on volatile commodities, it keeps a country&rsquo;s economy stable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Cons of Fiat Currency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Similar to pros, fiat currency also has cons, and some of the significant ones are mentioned below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1. Although fiat currency is widely considered a more stable currency, particularly during a recession, critics argue that currency based on gold with a limited supply has better stability than fiat currency with an unlimited supply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2. When a country&rsquo;s economy faces a recession, or people lose trust in a government, fiat currency may lose its value to zero.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3. Since the power to produce or print fiat currency vests with the government, it can steal the citizens&rsquo; purchasing power even if they refuse to pay taxes. During such an instance, the government will slightly increase the fiat currency supply and then purchase whatever they need before the increase in money supply takes its toll on the rise in prices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">4. The government is compelled to issue new banknotes to replace the lost or damaged currency no longer in circulation. Sometimes, it creates more money than needed leading to the loss of value of fiat currencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Fiat Currency Vs. Crypto Currency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Comparing them with fiat currency will do good when the world is standing on the brink of embracing the new age economy driven by digital assets like cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, fiat currency is a legal tender or a currency considered legitimate and valued by a government and people worldwide. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency not backed by a government or any central authority.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But there is an advantage to Cryptocurrency. Both fiat and cryptocurrencies are not based on any underlying assets. Still, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, making counterfeiting by antisocial elements or unlimited printing by a central authority nearly impossible. In addition, although cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, it offers a high level of security.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The recent widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies is a sign that they will soon replace fiat currencies for our financial transactions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Wrapping It Up</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fiat currency or paper money arrived in the world of finance as a storage medium of our purchasing power and something that could eliminate the inefficiencies of the barter system. It allows us to purchase what we require without exchanging commodities or metal coins for the products or services we need. Moreover, because of its flexibility to store and transfer purchasing power, anyone can use it for specific economic activities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, governments have complete control over the fiat currency supply, which has no intrinsic value, and its value is determined by market forces of demand and supply. However, despite governments&rsquo; complete control over fiat currency supply, they must exercise extreme caution while producing or printing fiat currency. If not, the fiat currency&rsquo;s value may fall due to over-circulation, leading to hyperinflation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The stability of a country&rsquo;s economy, governance, and the impact of these factors on interest rates affect fiat currency&rsquo;s value. Political and economic instability is likely to weaken fiat currency&rsquo;s value and increase the costs of products and services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To cut a long story short, fiat money runs successfully as a storage medium of purchasing power on the firm belief of a country&rsquo;s citizens in their country&rsquo;s political and economic stability. It is also based on their faith that the fiat currency satisfies all their financial transactions. If that long-held faith is lost, it marks the end of a fiat currency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862353/ngj9tjx4ge8kojt2zl7c.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What Is Fiat Currency?

Hence, the interest rate on FD and the economic health of the nation are interrelated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862540/pp12w5fnqhbs1tkaxu9r.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 788px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The rising interest rate on Fixed Deposits may make you feel good, but is it really good? Well, the answer is No! We have to consider the Net Return, which is FD Interest Rate minus Inflation. These numbers show the real picture. No matter how high FD&rsquo;s interest rate is, if the net return is negative, in the long term, it will only decrease the purchasing power.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862567/yf6qjfsgllxwzuqfeyce.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 828px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above flow chart shows that when GDP Growth Rate is low with respect to the desired level, measures are taken to increase the demand and liquidity in the market. This is done by decreasing the repo rate so that the loans become cheaper and people take more loans for spending.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Hence, the demand and supply will increase, leading to a boost in economic growth. Simultaneously, it will also decrease the rate of FDs. If the liquidity continuously floats, it will pressurize inflation, and the policymakers will have to take measures to control inflation, as explained below chart:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the tug of war of GDP Growth rate and inflation, the government typically has a relatively short term view when it comes to growth, but as an institution, the Central Bank has a long term view where low inflation would eventually lead to high growth scenarios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We need to trust that our Central Bank will take care of all the GDP Growth Numbers. As an investor, we need to watch the market closely and follow our goals and invest accordingly.

The bread and butter came in every shape and size: quantitative easing, lower interest rates, and even pocket money for each citizen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But, a few things went terribly wrong. First, the liquidity was in excess amounts. Second, it was infused into the economy at the wrong time: lifting of CoVID induced lockdown and supply shortages triggered by the Russo-Ukraine conflict. In developed economies like US and UK, it could do nothing but create high inflation and a negative real rate of return. Now, increasing the interest rate is the only door open in front of them. It is as if a high dose of stimulus medicine damaged the liver of the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, the situation is quite different, and thankfully, we are still better placed. In the past, we have experienced this sort of inflation and successfully kept our real rate of return intact without slipping into negative territory. The credit goes to our economic think tank, which urged the RBI not to keep enough cash in hand and stay away from dumping unplanned yet excess stimulus packages into the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">History shows us that we have been accustomed to similar economic cycles. RBI pumps up liquidity during an economic slowdown to boost the economy and let the demand-supply wheel roll again. On the other hand, RBI increases the interest rates when the economy expands to suck the liquidity out of the system and let the steam out of the inflationary pressure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Indian economy sailed through the wild tides of the 2000 dot-com bubble and 2008 sub-prime crises. If the present CoVID pandemic crisis is similar to those crises, the way out depends on inflation data post dot-com bubble and subprime crises. The inflation data of the US and India is given in the table below:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862774/lryq3bcmqgbbuh4prwjj.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 246px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above chart clearly shows the following facts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unlike the US, India is familiar with its inflation. But India&rsquo;s economy is no more standalone. Today, India catches fever when the US sneezes. The rupee depreciation during FII outflow is a recent example.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the US, inflation during the post dot-com bubble and the subprime crisis wasn&rsquo;t high. So it provided enough room to stimulate the economy without fear of further spike in inflation. This is the prevalent strategy to come out of a crisis or recession when inflation is under control.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But during post-pandemic days, if the interest rate is continuously raised to curb inflation, it will open the door for a unique recession. In a sense, even fiscal policies are helpless, and the past lessons turn useless this time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Till now, the Fed is playing a very brilliant game; something economists say, &lsquo;a great balancing act&rsquo;: a clever attempt to cool off inflation by never letting the economy slip into recession. So let&rsquo;s hope the Fed will make a safe landing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even during this gloomy phase of the economy, opportunities are aplenty for investors to participate at a reasonably good valuation and invest in long-term wealth creation. Side by side, keep enough liquid funds to add positions to your equity holdings if the economy slips into another recession.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862879/bes59vmd1xrruwvijwwh.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Great Balancing Act of the Fed","seo_keywords":"The Great Balancing Act of the Fed","seo_description":"If you could paint a rosy picture of these gloomy times, it would have emerged something like this: you would have sold your crypto assets three months ago, sitting relaxed with no debts, don’t have any equity market exposure, especially in the US market, don’t drive a car which runs on fossil fuels and to add a pinch of salt and pepper, you have shorted Netflix.

And so does Technology! And when both come in together in financial markets, they move the world much more rapidly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the rise in technological advancement, algorithm-based trading (Algo trading) has changed the face of financial markets across the globe. The proliferation of Algo trading has been staggering in global markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Algo trading is a computerized rule-based process for placing large orders in the market, which almost eliminates manual human intervention. Though Algo and high-frequency trading (HFT) usually go together, they are not the same.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Algo trading involves placing trades based on defined criteria, either high frequency or low frequency. In high-frequency trading, the trader&rsquo;s advantage is speed, whereas, in low frequency, the strength is the underlying trading model.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">High-frequency trading has become the most pervasive use of Algo trading. However, an increase in total costs due to the increased number of transactions and the risk of trading errors limits the use of high-frequency trading by investors (hedge funds, equity mutual funds, etc.). On the other hand, low-frequency trading strategies where portfolios are rebalanced on a monthly or even annual basis builds on the core strength of Algo trading for formulating profitable trading strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687862964/avnw8soe3u7ucfdkvmy3.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 539px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Program-based, low-frequency trading strategies have their foundations in significant equity market anomalies, fundamental and risk-based. Anomalies are occurrences that deviate from the predictions of economic or financial models that challenge those models&rsquo; core assumptions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The presence of an anomaly indicates that a given assumption or model does not hold up in practice. For example, a stock is priced differently from how a model predicts it will be priced. These are some important anomalies that savvy investors have used for decades to beat the market: size (small cap outperforming large-cap firms) and value (firms with low book to market giving better returns than a high book to market firms). Moreover, liquidity anomaly (returns of neglected stocks outpace high liquid stocks) and profitability anomaly (firms with low profits generate relatively higher returns) exist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The past two decades saw the emergence of risk-based anomalies, which occur when the stocks are classified based on risk measures. There are several alternative risk measures: beta, skewness, idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL), and tail risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Beta is defined as a sensitivity coefficient, which measures systematic risk, and is priced in rational asset pricing theory. Prior empirical evidence shows high betas associated with low or negative alphas, also known as a beta anomaly. Theoretically, IVOL is a risk that can be diversified away. However, investors start becoming mindful of total risk when there are limited diversification opportunities. They start pricing entire risk rather than systematic risk leading to a positive risk premium for high IVOL stocks. The demand for lottery-like stocks, where stocks with high probabilities of large short-term up moves in the stock price are bid up by the lottery investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ample empirical evidence confirms the presence of risk anomalies and a risk puzzle, where low risk gives higher returns. Equity investors often overpay for risky stocks. In the Indian context, stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have high expected returns because investors cannot fully diversify away from the firm-specific risk. Since all measures are related to risk, there is a possibility that these anomalies entangle with each other.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over the years, another strand of thought calls anomalies imaginary (spurious correlation like the&nbsp;<em>Hemline or the Asprin indicator</em>) or irrelevant. It is also true that ​most of the supposed market anomalies academics have identified don&rsquo;t exist or are too small to matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nevertheless, even after so many years, anomalies exist because of irrationality in investor behavior and different types of investors present in the market. Both of these factors are not going to fade anytime. Therefore, the significance of behavioral factors in explaining the relationship between risk-based anomalies and stock returns piques the interest of many. For instance, prospect theory suggests that investors exhibit a risk preference when facing a prior capital loss. It is interesting to understand that the performance of both fundamental and risk-based anomalies varies due to factors like information uncertainty, level of market development, investor sentiment, and degree of capital flow restrictions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One can benefit from this understanding and gain vital insights for portfolio creation and strategy formulation. It is also possible to make investment strategies combining different anomalies. One can write an algorithm on relevant anomalies accounting for their interaction with the market. Remember, portfolio construction matters, and it matters a lot. How frequently is it rebalanced? What is the weightage given to different stocks or sectors?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear investors, it&rsquo;s time to upskill yourselves to understand the rapidly evolving stock market maths and economics. Let us make sense of these anomalies and translate market inefficiencies into profitable opportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687863041/kuqvlsuimoomlepanz0n.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What’s your Formula","seo_keywords":"What’s your Formula","seo_description":"High-frequency trading has become the most pervasive use of Algo trading.

Then, all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re in the middle of a stock market downturn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The most recent stock market fall occurred in early 2020, with the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Market volatility is still being driven by the epidemic, inflation, and the crisis in Ukraine. However, a pandemic isn&rsquo;t required for the stock market to fall. Market downturns are common and can be triggered by a variety of circumstances. Concerns about increasing inflation and interest rates have caused severe volatility in the markets since the beginning of 2022.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite the fact that history can tell us how long bear markets, corrections, and crashes have lasted, no one receives a calendar notice stating the timing, nature, and severity of future declines.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Yes, market crashes are bound to happen. Here are a few things to do to handle the market meltdown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Know What and Why You Have</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A fearful reaction to a momentary downturn isn&rsquo;t a valid excuse to sell a stock. However, a review of your initial stock research notes may reveal some compelling reasons to sell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thorough stock research involves a documented record of each investment&rsquo;s strengths, shortcomings, and purpose, as well as factors that would cause each investment to be placed in the &ldquo;out&rdquo; box. Your study serves as a road map for investing, a concrete reminder of the characteristics that make a company worth owning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This paper can save you from discarding a perfectly solid long-term investment out of your portfolio simply because it had a terrible day during a market slump. On the other hand, it also gives rational grounds for selling a stock.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Prior to investing in stocks, you should have determined your risk tolerance or how much volatility you&rsquo;re ready to tolerate in exchange for larger prospective rewards. Investing in the stock market is always risky, but the capacity to ride out the bad times and stay engaged for the inevitable rebound, which is always on the horizon historically, is what makes for good long-term returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It&rsquo;s fine if you neglected this phase and are only now questioning how well your investments match your personality. Measuring your real reactions to market turbulence will give useful information in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Believe in Diversification</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you&rsquo;ve spread your money across multiple asset classes like stocks and bonds, your returns may change &mdash; and maybe for the better &mdash; when the market falls. Diversification, or dispersing your money over a variety of investments, is critical for smoothing the ride through a volatile market and lowering investment risk. Diversifying your assets (eggs) ensures that they aren&rsquo;t all invested in the same thing (basket). As a result, if one stock or industry has a terrible day, your other assets may be able to compensate for the losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Diversification is already built-in if you&rsquo;ve chosen a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; strategy, such as investing in a target-date retirement fund. In this circumstance, it&rsquo;s better to take a deep breath and believe that your portfolio will weather the storm. You&rsquo;ll still get some unpleasant short-term jolts, but you&rsquo;ll avoid losses that your portfolio can&rsquo;t recover from.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Prepare to Purchase the Dip</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dips in the market might sometimes be a good time to purchase. Consider buying stocks on the cheap when the market is down. The key lies in staying prepared for a decline in pricing and being willing to put some money down to grab bargains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here&rsquo;s how to know if you&rsquo;re ready to invest in the dip: You already have an emergency fund, money set aside for retirement, and cash on hand for day-to-day costs. You&rsquo;ve put money away in case of a flash sale, and you have a running Wishlist of particular equities you&rsquo;d want to acquire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You won&rsquo;t catch the stock at its bottom if you purchase on the drop, but that&rsquo;s alright. The idea is to be opportunistic with assets that you believe have long-term potential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stay prepared to freeze in place at the window of opportunity. Rupee-cost average your way into an investment is one method to overcome the worry of bad timing. When other investors are sitting on the sidelines &mdash; or heading for the exits &mdash; rupee-cost averaging may put your money to work by smoothing out your purchase price over time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Get Information from Some Trusted Sources</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When the stock market is performing well, and your portfolio is increasing in value, being an investor is a gratifying experience. When circumstances are rough, though, self-doubt and ill-advised strategies may take hold. Even the most self-assured saver-investor might be swayed by short-term thinking. Don&rsquo;t allow your financial ambitions to be derailed by self-doubt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Consider hiring a financial adviser to examine your portfolio and offer an unbiased opinion on your financial strategy. Knowing you can contact someone to talk you through difficult situations is an extra plus.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Think from the Long-Term Perspective</span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When the stock market falls, it can be tough to stand by and watch your portfolio&rsquo;s value collapse. It&rsquo;s especially difficult to see your portfolio decline during a year when you&rsquo;ve been unwell, bereaved, or lost or changed employment as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. Certainly, it&rsquo;s natural to be gloomy following a crisis, but when it comes to long-term investing, doing nothing is usually the best option.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It&rsquo;s vital to keep in mind that selling investments during a slump lock in your losses. Consider the COVID-related market catastrophe in February 2020. Assume you have a lakh of rupees invested in an exchange-traded fund or ETF.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During the 2020 meltdown, such a fund may have dropped by more than 30% of its value. You would have locked in that 30% loss if you had sold, but if you had stayed on, you would have received your money back or have recovered your losses till August and seen it rise since then.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you plan to reenter the market at a more favorable moment, you&rsquo;ll almost definitely pay more for the privilege and forgo some (if not all) of the rebound profits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stock market collapses are upsetting, but all it takes is patience and prudent judgment. Post market downturn, if you can, purchase more stocks and consider investing in stocks that you can keep for the long term. You can always consider the stock market as highly volatile. So, even if it is at an all-time low today, it will likely increase in the near future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687863209/wiapwuhwrgk3s3qdzd1r.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How to Handle a Market Downturn?","seo_keywords":"How to Handle a Market Downturn?","seo_description":"The most recent stock market fall occurred in early 2020, with the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In other words, human life is not a straight line between birth and death; there is a lagging phase before death called retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One day every one of us will have to experience the retirement phase in our lives. Unfortunately, most people enter this phase without much planning or forethought. Some people resort to retirement planning that will not provide sufficient funds to lead a comfortable old age phase of life. So, they put a limit on their expenditure and lead a life of frugality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although retirement planning is preparation and planning for the future, it needs to be discussed along with the present. Indeed, retirement is seen as &lsquo;sitting back and watching the sunset&rsquo; but to &lsquo;sit back&rsquo; comfortably, everyone needs a fallback plan that generates a revenue stream to lean on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article explains the common retirement planning mistakes and shows the importance of proper retirement planning and how to embrace your old age with no fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Early Birds Get Extra Mileage</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most of us wait till we cross 60 years of age to start retirement planning, the prevailing attitude among the working class. So, naturally, the lifestyle of the people improves when they start earning. But the failure to plan for retirement causes a sudden drop in this improved lifestyle. So, the elderly retired people have to make compromises in their lifestyle.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moreover, they are dependent on the existing pension institutions and schemes that lack proper retirement planning methods. In reality, retirement planning should be a more hands-on approach with a mixture of disciplined investment and spending habits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Early birds get extra mileage in every endeavor, and retirement planning is not different. So start planning and investing for your retirement from the day you start earning. Now, let&rsquo;s look at the importance of retirement planning step-by-step.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What&rsquo;s Next After Your Work-Life?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Everyone knows that they can&rsquo;t work and earn for their entire life. But, then, after retirement, you come out of the world of working and earning an income. Then obviously, a question arises in your mind: What next?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You may ask yourself: &lsquo;What do I do to create a regular income to support myself and my family?&rsquo; Of course, you can save from what you earned. But savings have their own limitations. &lsquo;An idiot with a plan can beat a genius without a plan,&rsquo; says Warren Buffet, a legendary investor. So, plan your retirement well. Financial markets provide excellent investment options such as equity, bonds, and mutual funds. You can invest in those instruments as per your risk appetite. Remember that &lsquo;financial market investments are subject to market risks; read all scheme-related documents carefully.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Few Retirement Planning Ideas</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now you are aware of the importance of retirement planning, and here we list five retirement planning ideas that would help you in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Set Up A Retirement Fund</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do you have a retirement fund in place? Mainly, you wouldn&rsquo;t. There is nothing to feel bad about because the case is the same with most Indians. However, if you lack a retirement fund, you have not considered your retirement planning yet. Pension funds or retirement funds allow individuals to set aside a portion of their income for retirement. These funds, an essential requirement for the elderly, are also as critical as the emergency fund. Creating a retirement fund also displays a high financial IQ of a person and motivates him to create an alternate revenue source.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. A Tax Saver</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most people save for retirement funds without realizing that they are excellent tax-saving instruments. Creating a retirement fund at an early age adds to the benefits. If you begin putting money into your retirement fund from the day you start earning, it opens a door for tax saving at every corner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Consider Inflation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is a naked truth that inflation eats away your savings. Let&rsquo;s take, as an example, the Fixed Deposit (FD) scheme, the traditional investment vehicle of Indians. The current highest interest rate of an FD in India is 6% per annum. With the prevailing 7.7% inflation rate, an FD fails to provide you with a return or profits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This means that you should consider inflation while you plan for retirement. Therefore, you should calculate and invest in the right places that beat inflation rates and provide a consistent return when you cross 60 years of age.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Save Costs</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Being young comes with several benefits. The prominent one among them is that you can save a lot of money out of your earnings for your retirement. For example, youngsters invite a lower insurance premium, and the amount goes up with age as a person&rsquo;s health and mortality risk increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Smaller Chunks of Savings</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another advantage of starting early retirement planning is saving relatively smaller chunks of money to attain your retirement goal. Conversely, if you start late, you will have to make substantial savings for the same retirement goal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s make it clear by a simple calculation. To save ₹1200 in 12 months, you need to keep ₹100 per month, but how much the savings chunk would be if have to save the same amount in 6 months? It would be ₹200 per month, a 100% increase in your savings effort. Always relate this analogy to your retirement planning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Retirement Planning: The Need of The Hour</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to a recent Economic Times report, nearly 80% of Indians don&rsquo;t plan for retirement. The report also states that about 60% of urban class Indians spend most of their income rather than saving or investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India still doesn&rsquo;t have a solid social security system, mainly to provide retirement benefits for its elderly population. In addition, government-sponsored pension funds and Employees&rsquo; Provident Funds (EPFs) might not be enough to provide inflating beating returns. Therefore, in short, retirement planning is the need of the hour.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687863400/rag9bblwq40k3gkvbqtk.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Gravity of Retirement Planning in Your Financial Planning","seo_keywords":"The Gravity of Retirement Planning in Your Financial Planning","seo_description":"One day every one of us will have to experience the retirement phase in our lives.

This simple quote delivers a pearl of age-old wisdom: your health is the cornerstone of your wealth. In other words, we need money to create wealth, and we should devote our physical and mental efficiency to earning money. But, in reality, making money and investing it wisely is not enough. To become rich and wealthy, we need to be healthy in the first place. Several pieces of research have proven that this age-old wisdom is correct &ndash; there is a positive correlation between an individual&rsquo;s health and wealth creation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Longevity nurtures prosperity. A healthy lifestyle will improve your life expectancy, which gives you more time to grow your investments. That also means more room for the magic of compounding to build your wealth. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from improved life expectancy, a healthy lifestyle develops proactiveness and creativity in a person. A healthy person is always cheerful, optimistic, and active, helping him make wise investment decisions and earn more money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other side, an unhealthy lifestyle is associated with misery, pessimism, and negativity. Several scientific studies have been published in support of this fact. An unhealthy lifestyle adversely affects both your psychological and physiological well-being. Poor health lets you spend less time at work and brings down your work quality. It will adversely affect your potential for earnings, and at the same time, it increases your medical expenses. In short, all these factors negatively influence your earnings and wealth creation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To make the matter worse, following an unhealthy lifestyle, especially during younger years, will lead to a middle-age health crisis. Moreover, it will negatively impact your retirement as most people do a more significant part of their retirement savings and investments during their middle age. Sometimes ignorance of the positive correlation between health and wealth may cost you dearly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Accumulation of health is equally important as the accumulation of wealth. Being rich and wealthy is not about hefty bank accounts or deep pockets; it is all about a healthy body and mind that aids you in earning more and standing strong when odds are against you in the money game.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&lsquo;Be healthy to be wealthy&rsquo; should be your life mantra, and it&rsquo;s time to adopt some healthy lifestyle tweaks like eating nutritious diets, drinking clean water, regular exercise, and meditation.

When we see moms, we see PERFECTION. No one chooses their mother, yet everyone has a perfect one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For those who have loved and lost, whose mothers brightly smile down upon them from the beyond, someone said once, Do not cry because she has gone; smile because she was here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The world often refers to Moms as a superwoman, donning a superhero cape with multiple hands, each hand doing a different task perfectly &ndash; an effortless juggler between work, quickest to make sacrifices, and blessed with infinite patience and tirelessness!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While this is true, it also means that mothers face an incredible amount of pressure to be &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; all the time. Being a mother of two, I take the liberty of saying that motherhood has been the most rewarding part of my life but is messy too (both literally and figuratively)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As beautiful as motherhood is, every mother has good days and bad days. There are those moments when everything seems just right, and then there are those days when things seem to go all wrong. There&rsquo;s so much love, but also frustration and sometimes anger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This unwritten rule is that one has to be a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; mom, and one and all feel the associated guilt. The working mom often feels guilty if she cannot adequately juggle the roles of wife, mother, businesswoman, friend, and daughter. The stay-at-home mom may feel a sense of dread for desiring a child-free moment of peace. Add to those other everyday stressors ranging from financial to emotional to social and educational. It becomes pretty easy to focus on one&rsquo;s perceived failings as a mother.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When frustrated and stressed, one tends to feel inadequate about our abilities as a mother&mdash;feeling guilty by responding to a problematic situation in a less than perfect way (as per one&rsquo;s perspective).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Well, guess what? Its high time imperfections are embraced and viewed as a perfect opportunity for growth. In the book Wabi-Sabi &ndash; finding happiness beyond weakness, Christopher A. Weidner explains how slight imperfections actually make things unique and lead people to a deeper enjoyment of the present moment to lead them to happiness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor also needs to accept the imperfections. Often when one looks back at the investment decisions, they believe that they couldn&rsquo;t get the &lsquo;market timing&rsquo; right!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Market timing is an investment strategy that works on the principle of predictions in sync with the sale and purchase decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is crucial to overcome this constant urge to time the market. In the words of Peter Lynch, an American investor and mutual fund manager &ndash;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While the world celebrated Mother&rsquo;s Day this weekend, last week witnessed events in the financial world &ndash; RBI interest rate hike, US Fed increasing the rates, Berkshire Hathway&rsquo;s annual shareholder&rsquo;s meeting held in physical mode after three years, and the opening of LIC IPO, one of the largest of its kind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With all this, the stock market fell along expected lines and observing what happened in the past can help you make a guesstimate. All of these are events that challenge the ability of the investor to time the market. A big reason for the fall is the cost of funds (coupon rates) is rising globally. They will increase further. The bull market, which began in March-end 2020, was fueled by the rampant printing of unbacked currency. Easy money is mother&rsquo;s milk to a bull market. Now that cost of funds is rising, the foundations of that bull market are shaking.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687863869/cxkgwbzmabvbe5z3vgew.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 729px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But let this not shake you and your investment strategy, and trust me, a sound one comes in handy in many ways. It doesn&rsquo;t just allow people to maintain their finances and investments better. It also helps them enhance their scope of earnings and strengthen their risk appetite by enabling them to build a diverse and robust portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And having done that, remind yourself frequently of Wabi-Sabi (Japanese philosophy from the XIIth century!), which goes in the opposite direction to perfectionism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ask yourself what you wish for, who you wish it with, and why.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealth should give you the freedom to do what you like; do it with the people you want, and do it for the reason you wish.

Since then, LIC has been the synonym for life insurance policies and has enjoyed a monopoly in the life insurance sector. But, this monopolistic story of LIC took a slight twist when private life insurance players entered the Indian market in the year 2000. Nevertheless, LIC still retains around 65% of the life insurance market share.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In March 2022, LIC opened its door to investors by shedding a 5% Government stake and raising $8 billion, inflating its market valuation to $160 billion. Indian government&rsquo;s plan was to divert this money to bring the fiscal deficit below 7% of GDP. But the economic tides were surging against the government&rsquo;s agenda. Rising global interest rates, the Russia-Ukraine war, rising inflation, and slowing domestic economic growth that was feared to lead to stagflation compelled the government to postpone LIC&rsquo;s Initial Public Offering (IPO) listing. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We can notice, from the government&rsquo;s action of reducing the size of the IPO by two-thirds, that the government is desperate to close the fiscal deficit gap and the renewed IPO deal is ideal for the current gloomy macroeconomic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since then, cutting its valuation in half, LIC plans to list only 3.5%, i.e., equivalent to $2.7 billion, bringing its market valuation only up to $77 billion. However, even with its half-size, LIC IPO is still the largest one in Indian history, topping the $2.5 billion IPO of Paytm, which is now down by 72% &mdash; another probable reason LIC slash down its market valuation.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now the question is: Does this market valuation make LIC IPO an attractive buy for investors? Obviously, the answer to the question is subjective, solely based on your judgment after looking at the prominent pros and cons of the LIC IPO listing given below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The significant strengths of LIC are as follows. The baron of the life insurance industry has almost $500 billion in assets and 250 million policyholders (more than half of them are loyal customers). In addition, LIC has a million-strong army of policy agents to whom the life insurance behemoth offers price discounts. It is also the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;largest firm by underwritten life insurance policy premiums.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from solid credentials and reduced valuations, LIC has a few flaws. Currently, LIC faces heavy competition from private players. A significant portion of LIC&rsquo;s insurance policies is sold by its policy agents, while its rivals sell insurance policies through agents, banking networks, and direct online sales. In addition, the exotic life insurance products offered by private players have blunted the market penetration of LIC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Being highly controlled by the government, LIC is speculated to meet the fate of General Insurance Corporation of India Limited (GIC), another government-controlled enterprise. GIC was listed in 2017, and since then, it has been in a downward spiral until it lost 68% of its price value.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Adding to the woes, government-owned enterprises usually do not arouse investor interest, and the period of tighter monetary policies isn&rsquo;t a good time for IPOs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When you weigh both the strengths and flaws of LIC, it becomes apparent that LIC will maintain its dominant position in the life insurance sector in the long run. Therefore, the conservative pricing of the IPO has increased the probability of investors minting some money now.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Devotees of LIC beware: add LIC IPO to your satellite portfolio with limited allocation without disturbing the core portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">LIC is open for orders from the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to the 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of May.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687864165/vb5xiwrdst5y8trzgrhp.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"LIC IPO – Alpha Analysis","seo_keywords":"LIC IPO – Alpha Analysis","seo_description":"Life Insurance Corporation of India, or LIC (as we all fondly call it), was established in 1956, nearly a decade after Indian independence.

Hundreds, if not thousands, exist for every successful college dropout. These survivors do not represent the norm but the anomalies at one end of a distribution curve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We forget that success is never guaranteed.&nbsp;Most businesses fail, and most people do not become rich or famous.

One should try and give it the best shot, just that we should be realistic with our understanding of reality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let the survivorship bias make you happy listening to old songs, looking at old photographs, reminiscing old memories and happy times of the past. But don&rsquo;t let it overtake your financial decision making.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The human tendency to study successful outcomes and ignore the results of the accompanying failure without examining all the data leads to loss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Survivorship bias is pervasive in the financial market and affects everyone from an analyst to an institutional or retail investor. Not adequately considering the risks may lead to wrong decisions! It results in a sample selection bias when one includes only the existing or &ldquo;surviving&rdquo; stocks for portfolio performance (Skewness!!). More often than not, it leads to portfolio returns and performance overestimation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We forget the &ldquo;surviving&rdquo; observations often have survived due to their stronger-than-average resilience to challenging conditions. It automatically leaves out other observations that have ceased due to such conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One can observe the implications of survivorship bias in index inclusions and exclusions. Poorly performing stocks are removed from the index because of the minimum market capitalization criteria. The number of components remains constant though the constituents change over time. Different members are swapped in and out of the index according to their appropriateness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Making an investment decision solely on past performance is not advisable as the data sample gives an overly optimistic view. This risk is exaggerated when one tries to recreate a company&rsquo;s fundamentals through simulation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Once you are familiar with survivorship bias, you can spot it everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, a gym might feature those who&rsquo;ve toned up quickly due to going to their facilities. Of course, they never show those who signed up but achieved no more than a depleted bank account.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And once aware of its existence, it will change how you think about life, the stock market, diets, restaurants and basically everything. It will reshape your past perspective and give you a clearer view of the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So next time you hear/read about a success story, think of all who tried to do what that person did and failed.&nbsp;<strong>Consider What You Don&rsquo;t See.&nbsp;</strong>Overcome the survivorship bias by questioning what is missing. Look out for all who started on the same path but did not make it. Try and learn from both success and failure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Information is the key to sound financial decision making. Vet data, Invest in data, Buy data, Create data. Base your decisions on actual observations, consisting of all the variables (both best performing and poor performing) &ndash;bonds, stocks, or mutual funds. Evaluate returns of both surviving and non-surviving strategies. Otherwise, a seemingly stellar track record may be an incomplete and biased reflection of reality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One should also consider other aspects of the manager, such as their underlying investment philosophy, the robustness in their strategy design, and the efficiency in their portfolio management and trading. These traits are essential in delivering a good investment experience and helping investors achieve their goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;A stupid decision that works out well becomes a brilliant decision in hindsight.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&mdash; Daniel Kahneman</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687864392/rx2hlly3kzfhlbu4rcic.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Forgotten Failures and Flops: Making the most of it","seo_keywords":"Forgotten Failures and Flops: Making the most of it","seo_description":"Everyone loves a survivor, the one who succeeds.

Legendary investors are the greatest ones only because of the unique investing strategies they acquired by spending years on trial and error, market analysis, and research. Their exceptional skills, without doubt, turned them into some of the wealthiest persons on this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Legendary investors eat and sleep with the markets. With their years-long hard work and patience, they have absorbed the market behavior in their heads. So, it is no wonder that every retail investor secretly wishes to follow the legends&rsquo; investment success (blindly, without making any effort) to strike it big in no time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Reality never turns much rosy as our imaginations. Every individual possesses unique cognitive abilities, skills, and talents in the real world, which means we are entirely different. Therefore, whenever we try to emulate someone, we put a psychological limit on ourselves, and this will eventually halt us from making our own decisions or being creative in our style. More importantly, people who try to make a fortune by copying others will turn into losers in the long run. Luckily, we have got a brain, and it is our responsibility to put it to work!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Michael Burry, a physician, and a legendary American hedge fund manager, once stated that Warren Buffet didn&rsquo;t copy the investing style of his mentor, Ben Graham, despite he got the opportunity to do so. Instead, Warren Buffet chose to pave his own path and managed money his way by abiding by his own rules.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article discusses whether it will be good or not to copy successful investors&rsquo; portfolios or their investing strategies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Does Portfolio Cloning work?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Everyone indeed fancies making money from the stock market. But, contrary to popular notions, portfolio cloning is not the right way to do it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Portfolio cloning has been made famous by social media influencers and the people who make a living by giving stock market &lsquo;tips&rsquo; to their clients. But unfortunately, several people claim to beat the stock market by portfolio cloning. In reality, they are just fraudsters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You should consider that as retail investors, we are not equipped with the sophisticated tools for research and analysis like that of successful billionaire investors. Therefore, blindly copying their portfolio simply never works for retail investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Financial Goals Vary</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Have you ever thought about the financial goals of legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala? Do you think they have similar personal and financial goals as you do? Most probably, not!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every investor enters the stock market with entirely different goals from another investor. So, expecting someone else&rsquo;s investing decisions will help you achieve your financial goals is a myth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">More than that, investing is all about leading a life free from financial stress. Therefore, your priority should be to acquire stocks or other assets to help you meet your financial goals rather than copying a successful investor&rsquo;s stock picks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Investment Spans Vary</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Big investors often invest larger chunks of money in stocks or other assets and stay invested for extended periods. This strategy often brings enormous returns for investors with deep pockets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, this long-term investment strategy with vast amounts of money never works for retail investors because the limits of their financial resources, financial goals, and risk appetites vary. For instance, to achieve a financial goal within a year, a short-term mutual fund investment will be the right pick rather than a stock market investment with an anticipated return of 15% in the next 5 to 6 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Risk Appetites Change</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Why does risk appetite change? The risk of losing a thousand rupees is not the same for a person with a six-digit salary and a person who can barely make a living. Similarly, as risk appetite change from person to person, it also changes from investor to investor. It varies with age and the depth of an investor&rsquo;s pocket.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor in his 40s prefers to finance their child&rsquo;s education or create a retirement fund. As a result, he might not divert his earnings into the stock market but would invest in debt instruments for a steady revenue stream. On the other hand, a 20-something investor would prefer risky stock market investments across different segments and sectors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Trouble with Diversification</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In theory, diversification is an investing strategy in which investments are made across different asset classes to avoid the risk of putting money in a single investment. In simpler terms, diversification is all about not putting all your eggs in one basket since a single mistake can make you lose all of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But, in reality, to put all your eggs in different baskets, of course, you need more baskets, and to own more baskets, you need to spend more money, and to spend more money, you must have more money!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The idea is quite simple. Big institutional investors diversify because they got plenty of money at their disposal, and a retail investor might not have such financial resources. So, simply copying an institutional investor&rsquo;s portfolio or diversification tactics wreaks havoc on your investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Timing Trouble</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The entry-exit timing of big investors is often hidden from the public; mostly, it happens without your knowledge. The information regarding the interest of a prominent investor in a particular stock and the price at which they bought it is available only after they have taken the position in a specific stock.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, a successful investor named Varun bought 100 shares of a company called Nirvana at ₹100 per share. The information about his investment becomes known to the public only after making the investment. When the information is out to the public, he may purchase more with the retail investors. It may ultimately lead to the overvaluation of the stock owing to the sudden spike in demand. Therefore, the stock ceases to be a good return generating asset for a retail investor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, looking through the portfolios of big investors would be helpful to generate profitable stock market investment ideas. Then you can pick the stock after an in-depth market and equity analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To keep the long story short, investing, in general, is entirely subjective. That means an appropriate investment strategy for a prominent investor may not be suitable for you (and vice-versa). So, you should check your risk appetite, financial profile, and goals before jumping into investments and thoroughly plan the best investment strategy accordingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687864606/lf7ud1whbmgqpnunr1au.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Does Copying Work in The Game of Investing?","seo_keywords":"Does Copying Work in The Game of Investing?","seo_description":"Greatness is the byproduct of a person’s exceptional qualities and behavior.

Festivals of Baisakhi, Vishu, Rongali Bihu, Naba Barsha, Vaisakhadi and Puthandu-Pirappu being celebrated all across the country reflect India&rsquo;s diversity and also emphasize unity. Traditionally associated with the harvest season, these festivals celebrate the vitality and abundance of nature. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The celebrations coincided with Mahavir Jayanti and Ambedkar Jayanti, followed by Hanuman Jayanti, Good Friday and Easter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The intent is not to present the holiday calendar to you all but to highlight that we have diversity all around us. Still, we think in binary terms &ndash; Right/ wrong, Good/Bad, Yes/No, Happy/Sad, and so on, visible in all aspects of our lives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I will share another incident that would clearly illustrate this thought process. Cooking dal is a fundamental activity in everyone&rsquo;s kitchen. However, the ideal method of cooking it might differ. Some may wait for the cooker to let out three whistles, and some may pressure cook the dal by keeping the pressure in and not releasing it multiple times, wasting time and fuel.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The basic premise is that there is no ABSOLUTE one correct answer. For instance, we all know two multiplied by two is 4, which is correct but is not the only right way to get the answer 4. Different alternative paths can be followed like 4*1, 5-1, 2+2, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Absolutes are blinders that don&rsquo;t allow room for empathy, curiosity, or imagination. It makes us hard-hearted, brittle, and angry. Angry, dogmatic trolls, reacting violently at a difference of opinion and demanding homogeneity over diversity are all the result of this very attitude.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">What can be done?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The first is to be aware and then allow yourself to understand that there is more than one way to cook the dal, get four as the answer and even achieve financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Next, take inspiration from Google Maps, which never condemns even if one takes a wrong turn. It simply re-routes and shows the next best possible alternative. It acknowledges that there are possibly many different ways to reach the destination, and one can choose their path. There is no point yelling, scolding, or feeling bad about taking a less travelled road. The intent should always be to help fix the problem and not blame.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be aware of the biases that lock our thinking.&nbsp;&lsquo;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&rsquo;&nbsp;With limited tools,&nbsp;people often apply them inappropriately or indiscriminately. Usually, a person familiar with a single subject has a&nbsp;confirmation bias that it is the answer to everything. We prefer to do what we have rather than look for a better alternative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There&rsquo;s more than one way to skin a cat!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are multiple ways/ approaches to solve one problem. Specifically, applying these thoughts in financial planning would mean diverse ways to create a portfolio, explore new asset classes, new geographies and expand your horizon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Diversity is even more critical today when one needs a resilient portfolio to face the challenges posed by the energy prices and interest rates. Some sectors are energy-dependent, while others benefit from high energy prices. It is crucial to ensure that the portfolio isn&rsquo;t all pointing in the same direction on interest rates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Integrating the right tools with the right mindset is vital to achieve in life &ndash; be it mental peace, financial prosperity or professional success.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be the Google Map for everyone you care about and even yourself!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687864745/lt5amb566athfnjjzmy8.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Rethinking Diversity","seo_keywords":"Rethinking Diversity","seo_description":"In the last couple of days, India has celebrated not one but multiple festivals.

The irony is that the day is also known as April Fool&rsquo;s Day, a day for pranks, jokes, fooling people, and getting fooled by others. Of course, pranks, jokes, and fooling around for a single day are fun and memorable, but what if you are fooled for an entire year or a lifetime?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Mistakes happen. Bad financial pieces of advice and wrong financial decisions can wreak havoc in anyone&rsquo;s life. But if we don&rsquo;t learn from the mistakes or hold on to them, no one can save us from the financial turmoil we invite into our life. It&rsquo;s OK to be an April fool, but becoming a financial fool would be a lifetime disaster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Continuously learning from mistakes and making the right money decisions &ndash; the dos and don&rsquo;ts with your money &ndash; protect you from becoming a financial fool for the rest of your life. So, on this April Fool&rsquo;s day, we discuss seven financial mistakes and how to avoid them in your journey to attain financial freedom. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1.&nbsp; Ignoring inflation:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inflation is a reality. The value of our currency is depreciating every day, and the price of goods rises according to it. It is like stealing a little money from your pocket every day. The money you earn today is less valuable to buy things for you in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The common mistake most of us make is that we earn by calculating our expenses and savings to the tune of the present value of the money. Then, finally, when the moment arrives to fulfill a desire like buying a car or making an investment like creating a retirement fund, most of us fall prey to a financial prank staged by rising inflation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We need to earn and invest by keeping inflation-adjusted rates in mind to avoid this mistake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. The debt-free concept is an illusion:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We have been brought up thinking that debts are bad and it is ideal to lead a complete debt-free life. In truth, we have been deluded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If the interest rate is low and tax-deductible, for instance, a home loan worth 30 lakhs at a 7% interest rate with up to 2 lakhs of tax-deductible interest. Therefore, for an individual who falls under the 33% tax bracket, the interest for the home loan rate stands at a meager 4.7 percent. This is also an example of good debt because you can easily earn more by investing rather than paying interest on a bad debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is not debt that is bad; it is our inability to distinguish between good and bad debts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Failure to create an emergency fund:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Human life is uncertain. So, creating an emergency fund holds the utmost importance in our life. A 100 percent liquid and easily accessible emergency fund is a must to meet the uncertainties in life like job loss, medical emergency, etc. No need to mention that if you fail to create one, you end up being a financial fool for the rest of your life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Miss to build up an equity portfolio:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The old school of investing always believed in traditional investments like Fixed Deposits (FD), gold, real estate, and insurance policies. It fails to realize that all these instruments have lost their sheen in this today&rsquo;s highly volatile and inflated financial world. Most of these traditional investments are either illiquid or fail to beat the current inflation rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A thoroughly researched and well-planned equity portfolio can do wonders in giving you inflation-beating returns. But it is a bit riskier than traditional investments. In today&rsquo;s world of finance, taking no risk is the most dangerous risk ever. Or else, you can consider traditional investments to generate long-term returns and take up equity on a short-term horizon. Whatever be your investment strategy, it would be financial foolishness if you miss to build up a diversified equity portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Considering only pre-tax return:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The pre-tax rate of investment returns tells you the profits excluding taxes. The percentage of tax varies among different classes of people. So, the post-tax return would be significantly less for a person who falls under the highest tax bracket.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The marketing team of an investment product (pranksters) will only reveal pre-tax returns to fool you. Beware of these marketing tactics and understand that the return from which tax is deducted is your actual return. Therefore, for an investor under a 33% tax slab, a 5% capital gain income which attracts 10% tax in the long term, is better than a 6% return which attracts 33% tax.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. Estate planning is meant only for the older generation</strong>:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Estate planning is about passing down assets or investments to future generations after a person&rsquo;s demise. The assets can be real estate properties, vehicles, or financial investments. Unfortunately, no one can predict when a need for estate planning arises because uncertainties fill the lives of both young and old. As a result, estate planning is meant not only for the wealthy or older generation; it is for everyone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A well thought estate planning makes sure that your wishes are fulfilled when you aren&rsquo;t around. It shows your care for your loved ones that they are financially taken care of after you take leave from this planet. It also allows a smoother yet peaceful transfer of your assets to your descendants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Insurance is a waste of money:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As mentioned earlier, life is uncertain, and we need something to hedge against it. An insurance policy is a shield of protection against mishaps in life. Therefore, in a true sense, insurance planning is an indispensable part of financial planning. While term plan insurance policies help you to attain an inflation-beating return, health insurance policies act as a risk mitigation tool in your life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our sedentary lifestyle and poor diet coupled with ever-increasing medical care expenses demand a health insurance policy for everyone, even if they seem to be super healthy. However, premium payments of an insurance policy are worth every penny and don&rsquo;t be a financial fool by trying to save them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors could fall for several other financial mistakes, but these are the sneakiest ones worth noting on this April Fool&rsquo;s day. But, again, keep in mind: it is OK to be an April Fool, but not OK to be a financial fool.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Akhil Bhardwaj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687867708/mtrjmp8syjcqvihmd9tt.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Let’s Vow Not to Be A Financial Fool on This April Fool’s Day","seo_keywords":"Let’s Vow Not to Be A Financial Fool on This April Fool’s Day","seo_description":"Mistakes happen.

Why does so much get done in the last few days, the last few hours of the month? What is the source of this magical level of productivity in these last days?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The answer to this is&nbsp;<strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Law!!</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do not confuse Parkinson&rsquo;s Law with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (A central nervous system disorder that affects movement). Parkinson&rsquo;s Law was first mentioned in The Economist in 1955, stating that the&nbsp;<strong>work expands to fill the time available for its completion</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thus, the output quality does not necessarily significantly improve despite the extra time. Think of it as your phone/ computer; you will fill it no matter how much data capacity you have. Similarly, howsoever huge a house is, the space will always fall short compared to the things in the house.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thus, from an institution&rsquo;s perspective, every employee turns into Batman or Catwoman during the month-end, with limited time superpowers. However, this is far from ideal for several reasons. It kills any semblance of work-life balance for employees. It creates a severe risk of errors and misjudgements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Parkinson&rsquo;s Law is also one of the best known and the most important laws of money and wealth accumulation. It was developed by English writer C. Northcote Parkinson many years ago, and it explains why most people retire poor.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Expenses always rise to meet income</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This Law says that no matter how much money people earn, they tend to spend the entire amount and a little more. Their expenses rise in lockstep with their incomes. Many people make today several times what they were earning at their first jobs. But somehow, they seem to need every penny to maintain their current lifestyles. No matter how much they make, there never seems to be enough. So deep down, we all know that too for wealth creation, but consumerism is a tricky beast to overcome</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Violate Parkinson&rsquo;s law daily with the right financial behaviours</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Pay yourself first, engage in mindful spending, invest for your future, invest in yourself, associate with the right people&nbsp;(Human beings tend to follow the crowd)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember Parkinson&rsquo;s law works everywhere &ndash; so never lose sight of the end goal, prioritize, establish deadlines, avoid procrastination and crush the cockroaches of productivity (Little time fillers &ndash; social media, feed reading that do not add value but waste your time)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So it is on purpose that I right to you all on March 31st. This date is a month-end; it&rsquo;s also the financial year-end in India. During this time, tax planning is crucial for most individual taxpayers. We all are engaged in multiple things, including completing our financial obligations from the tax planning perspective.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Filing income tax returns, linking PAN and Aadhaar and payment of advance tax are on everyone&rsquo;s to-do list. I am sure that you all have invested to save tax, but as per your financial plan. Many options are available. Which one to choose depends on the financial goals and risk profile.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Financial planning should come first!!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is essential to acknowledge that investment and tax planning must be done in April, not March. While everybody knows the importance of planning, many of us keep postponing such decisions until the end.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial decisions are taken only to meet the deadline, resulting in reduced returns and failing to serve the long-term goals. Therefore, getting the tax planning right is essential at the beginning itself.

So, it would be better to start a discourse on it by taking up &lsquo;five Ws and one H&rsquo;. Well, if you are not involved with any subject research, journalism, or any profession that involves information gathering, you may not be aware of the &lsquo;five Ws and one H&rsquo;. So, let&rsquo;s move forward after making this simple concept clear for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To keep it short and simple, &lsquo;five Ws and one H&rsquo; involves six crucial questions you should ask when collecting information or making a decision. Those questions are Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. So, for example, when you confront a problem, you could ask yourself questions like &lsquo;Who&rsquo; is involved in this issue? &lsquo;When&rsquo; did it happen? And the rest of the four Ws and one H questions. Asking these six questions opens the door for multiple perspectives on the problem and helps you reach a solution faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Robert Kiyosaki, a famous personal financial advisor, and author, says that &lsquo;why&rsquo; you want to achieve financial freedom is more important than &lsquo;how&rsquo; you want to achieve it. Therefore, finding your &lsquo;why&rsquo; for being rich and free is significant. Of course, finding &lsquo;why&rsquo; rests on your shoulder, but here we look into &lsquo;how&rsquo; you can attain financial freedom in six possible ways.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Know Thyself</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every person has different financial goals, ambitions, and dreams. So, the first step towards attaining financial freedom is to know yourself and your priorities. The priorities may include your preferred lifestyle, assets, and the size of your bank balance. Remember that setting priorities should culminate in a financial plan, and you must stick to the plan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Create A Secondary Revenue Stream</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Several pieces of research have shown that millionaires have at least seven sources of income. Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and the sixth richest person in the world, is an advocate for multiple revenue streams. He has famously remarked, &ldquo;Never depend on a single income. Instead, make investments to create a second source.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today&rsquo;s markets give plenty of investment opportunities, and anyone can choose freely from them to create cash flows.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Budgeting</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Savings is a superpower. Like all superpowers, savings are not easy to develop and deploy, but budgeting can help. Budgeting develops a habit of recording and tracking your income and expenses. You can create a household financial ledger to plan your expenses, savings, and activities to reach your financial goals. Then, at the end of each month, you can review your budget and analyze your achievements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The budgeting approach mentioned above is a standard method, but it would be better to develop your own strategy and stick to it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Create an Emergency Fund</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Human life goes up and down with intermittent phases of happiness and sorrow, prosperity and misery, health and illness like the readings of an Electrocardiogram (ECG) machine. However, everyone should realize that all these phases, both good and bad, have an end, and saving for the rainy day brings those bad days within our grasp. Therefore, taking up a life insurance policy, cutting unnecessary expenses, and creating a contingency fund are effective risk management initiatives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Invest</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Savings and investing are cousins. They both complement each other. For example, if a person actively invests his savings rather than keeping them idle in a savings account, he will achieve financial freedom sooner than a person who saves but fails to invest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing is not for the faint-hearted. It should be strictly driven by financial goals, risk appetite analysis, and timely churning of the portfolio according to ever-changing market conditions. Along with all these understandings, investors should fix the time horizon to keep their savings invested. It will help them keep an eye on the risks-rewards over a span and let them reap the fruits of compounding. It is no wonder famous scientist Albert Einstein regarded compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world and said, &ldquo;he who understands it (compound interest) earns it, he who doesn&rsquo;t pay it.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6.<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"> Have Patience</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Rome was not built in a day, and compounding works in similar ways. It never shows its true potential in a year or two. If you are a person who is very clear about your financial goals keeping an eye on long-term financial plans, you are an investor. You are nothing but a speculator if you don&rsquo;t fall in this category.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the words of Warren Buffett, &ldquo;Stock market is a place to transfer the money from the impatient to the patient.&rdquo;The story of the golden egg-laying goose we read in our primary school days also heralds the importance of patience in our life. In investing, always keep in mind that we can&rsquo;t eat the apple on the same day we plant a seed for the apple tree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Life is indeed uncertain. However precisely you may plan your life, chances are large that something somewhere may go wrong at any time. Anyway, no one should let the uncertainty pulls them back from planning their life and financial goals to the best of their abilities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Uncertainty is stressful, and unforeseen events can bring down one&rsquo;s lifestyle quality if they do not have sound financial plans in place. There is no doubt that financial planning ensures peace of mind and prosperity over the long term, but it can&rsquo;t be taught in a school like English. It is because financial goals differ for each of us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It would be apt to finish writing by giving perfect justice to the idea of financial freedom by quoting Chris Brogan: &ldquo;The goal isn&rsquo;t more money; the goal is to live our life on our own terms.&rdquo; This quote carries the essence of financial freedom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687869102/qb8d708yhdwmkqmwsyxx.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Six Paths towards Financial Freedom","seo_keywords":"Six Paths towards Financial Freedom","seo_description":"Financial freedom is a pretty subjective matter.

Moreover, crude oil is also a significant player in international macroeconomics that brings sudden changes in government policies and influences global crude oil prices. So, there is no wonder that a slight change in the global crude oil price has a massive impact on broader global economies and our personal lives.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870427/b4orvfidmwvfzpwki3xt.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 761px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Men had waged war for land, precious metals, and sometimes, ladies throughout history. But, those days were long gone and written to the rusty annals of human history. In today&rsquo;s Digital Age, waging war over land, precious metals, or even ladies is not a profitable venture. But, unfortunately, there arises another valuable asset worth fighting: oil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In an era in which peace is more profitable and sustainable than wars and conflicts, still, countries fight over oil. We still hear stories of oil wars during these modern times dominated by digital technology and the widespread transition towards green energy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, primarily an oil-importing country, a slight change in global crude oil prices will impact thousands of items ranging from tyres and cement to diapers and lipsticks. In broader terms, as oil price hike influences transportation and industrial production costs, it will also impact consumer prices of essential items. Moreover, the depreciation of the Indian Rupee also adds fuel to the fire and results in a current account deficit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870452/s32urfhcndbrnvp6mcob.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 555px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As crude oil prices influence the daily needs of Indians, a hike in its price is also powerful enough to affect our sentiments. As a result, we cut short our savings and investments focusing more on our survival.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870473/eq1mysj8a2lovf10ws1q.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 361px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In reality, we don&rsquo;t have much control over most things that happen in our lives. Remember that it is not the events that impact our lives but our reaction to them. Likewise, although we don&rsquo;t hold the reins of the crude oil price, we can bring down our dependency on it by embracing green energy sources, equipment, and vehicles. This bold choice will save our life, investments, economies, and environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now is the time to think differently and pick oil as a jack, not as an ace in our day-to-day life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nNeeru Seal</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870557/lirqvnrq8s9ep6sod69q.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"It’s Time to Pick Crude Oil as a Jack (Not as an Ace) in Economic Card Game","seo_keywords":"It’s Time to Pick Crude Oil as a Jack (Not as an Ace) in Economic Card Game","seo_description":"Crude oil, without doubt, has been turning the wheel of global economies for the past several centuries.

These inevitable disruptions have tumbled several industries down to dust while radically transforming others for good. But, in general, they are paving the way for innovative solutions for most sectors. As a result, today, technology dependence is higher in every human endeavor, from buying a movie ticket to making a significant financial transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The wealth management industry stands in the long queue of several significant sectors adapting and evolving with futuristic technologies. Long gone are the days when financial managers, advisors, and analysts spent hours poring over spreadsheets and mathematical formulas to perform financial calculations and analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thanks to all these positive developments in technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI). The New Age technology has now turned conventional financial analysis and wealth management into an entirely redundant process. This resulted in a promising financial landscape with more straightforward solutions for complex financial problems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These frequent disruptions in the arena of finance help investors as well. Today, an investor has access to an ecosystem that allows leveraging the latest technologies to effectively manage their wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now, let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how technological advancements (and disruptions) are transforming the current wealth management industry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Digital Identification and Automated Processes</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the early days, the financial industry, particularly the wealth management sector, relied heavily on manual intervention to take clients on board. The vast volume of paperwork was time-consuming and complicated both for the client and the financial service provider.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, the introduction of digital identification transformed the entire process into a paperless yet digital affair. Digital identification methods like Aadhaar e-KYC have eliminated manual intervention and allowed the wealth management industry to embrace automated operations tightly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">AI technology also helps the wealth management industry executives intelligently leverage the automated processes to take clients on board. All these latest technologies turned the entire process of client introduction and wealth management into an effortless activity. In fact, the whole process, which would have taken weeks with conventional methods, now takes only a couple of hours.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Automated Investment and Portfolio Management Services</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Automated client onboarding is only a tiny part of the technology-driven game in the wealth management industry. Today, financial analysts in the wealth management industry are increasingly deploying AI solutions to analyze the markets and manage their clients&rsquo; wealth. Automation of these processes enables wealth managers to provide their clients with an AI-driven customized financial service experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since AI takes care of every back-end process associated with the wealth management industry, the results would be highly objective and unbiased. It keeps human emotional bias at bay and brings higher levels of the discipline into wealth management, inviting higher returns from investments. The use of AI technology boosts the rapid evolution of the wealth management industry as everything from picking the right stocks to monitoring portfolios has been improved. However, the implementation of technology also gives room for further improvement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Algorithmic Predictive Analysis</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The days before the technological disruption in the wealth management industry, wealth managers had to do manual technical analysis to predict the price movements of the stocks. This involves perusing tons of historical price data, analyzing price charts, and using multiple mathematical formulas for calculating returns and assessing technical indicators.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, recent technological developments have transformed how financial experts manage their clients&rsquo; wealth. Today, wealth managers utilize AI algorithms and specialized tools to predict the prices of stocks. AI technology has significantly improved the accuracy of price predictions and the calculations of entry-exit price points of investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These days, wealth managers increasingly deploy AI algorithmic predictive analysis in financial and non-financial assets to help their clients achieve their financial yet personal goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Virtual Back-Testing of Investment Strategies</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is another excellent example of digitally automated wealth management evolution that utilizes technology to its advantage. In earlier days, although wealth managers and financial advisory experts manually devised wealth creation strategies, possibilities were nil to test these strategies in actual market conditions. Therefore, the return generating capability of such methods couldn&rsquo;t be predicted or realized until they were actually rolled out in the markets. As a result, this riskier investment endeavor creates a hit or miss investment and often puts clients&rsquo; money at risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With AI-driven automation tools, investment or wealth creation strategies can be tested thoroughly under existing market conditions. Automated back-testing of financial plans and investment strategies has made it possible to increase the accuracy of wealth managers&rsquo; decision-making, simultaneously reducing investment risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Automated Customer Service</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Clients are a significant factor in every industry, and the wealth management industry is responsible for satisfying every client&rsquo;s financial and personal goals. However, during the days without much technological advancement and support, wealth managers may find it challenging to cater to their clients&rsquo; requirements round the clock. Ultimately, this has led to the draining of resources, inversely affecting the quality of customer service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is the point where the current cutting-edge technologies globally &mdash; Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) &mdash; are helping the evolution of wealth management. Today, an increasing number of financial services deploy AI chatbots to handle customers&rsquo; queries. AI technology also reduces the pressure on financial experts in the wealth management arena by taking only relevant questions and transferring them to personnel. Furthermore, with the assistance of ML technology, AI tools can even learn from customer interaction and provide better customer service over time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Concluding Notes</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The new-age problems have new-age solutions. This is what the recent developments in technology display in the arenas of wealth management, investing, and trading. These new-age technologies rapidly transform the wealth management industry to meet the new age investor demands and expectations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most Indian and international wealth management services have already embraced these technological transformations. Therefore, you can benefit from subscribing to their wealth management services. With the futuristic combination of automated assistance and innovative solutions, these technology-friendly financial services can help you grow your wealth to achieve your financial goals in the shortest span.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870772/snrw1fcirqk9cg9fkgwm.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Know About Wealth Management’s Evolution with Technology","seo_keywords":"Know About Wealth Management’s Evolution with Technology","seo_description":"The tremendous progress in technology has been severely disrupting nearly every single sector for the past two decades.

Remind yourself of that each and every day.&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;Caroline Ghosn</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most of us visualize the finance world as predominantly male!! All are men &ndash; whether a hero or a villain, a winner or loser, iconic investor or scamster. Though times have changed considerably, but women still don&rsquo;t particularly have the upper hand regarding money matters. Women excel in all walks of life, however it is perceived that they are still struggling to reach the same levels in financial market participation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite the fact that Indian women have broken barriers and moved up the ladder with their talent, hard work and intelligence, our women account for only 11% of the workforce in the Indian financial sector (though lower than the global percentage of 16%). To name a few of many illustrious names&nbsp;(in no order of any preference)&nbsp;&ndash; Ms. Kalpana Morparia, Ms. Naina Lal Kidwai, Ms. Alice G Vaidyan, Ms. Arundhati Bhattacharya, Ms. Shyamala Gopinath, Ms. Shikha Sharma, Ms. Shanti Ekambaram, Ms. Usha Ananthasubramanian, Ms. Ranjana Kumar, Ms. Archana Bhargava and of course our Hon&rsquo;ble Finance Minister Ms. Nirmala Sitaraman.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nevertheless, the typical perception remains that women do not know how to invest. It is erroneous and unfortunate at the same time, as research shows that women invest better than men. Several studies (ET Money, Fidelity and academic literature) offer enough evidence that women&rsquo;s investment portfolios deliver better returns than men&rsquo;s.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The source of women&rsquo;s superior returns lies in how they trade. Or, instead, how they don&rsquo;t. Also, overconfidence is terrible, and women are less likely to fall victim to it. Women are generally more open about their situation and more willing to provide information. They are more risk-averse, more likely to be concerned about the ethical and social attitudes of the companies in which they invested. Women get into many hats and have multiple balls&nbsp;in the air every waking moment while walking a tightrope as homemakers, mothers, counsellors, caregivers, chefs, and many others. While constantly multitasking, they possess a greater level of discipline.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unfortunately, women themselves are not too confident about their financial skill-set. When women can do all other things independently, why not make financial decisions? They are better at saving but lack enthusiasm about investing, which may be due to age-old inequalities, lack of role models, absence of knowledge or experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Manisha Thakor, a financial planner and a consultant in Portland, Ore, highlights that &ldquo;Women are socialized to be perfect, to know everything before we take a step,&rdquo; making investing challenging for them. On the other hand, men are more comfortable making decisions without knowing everything. Thus, what is needed is to convince women that they can successfully handle money. Their best attribute as investors is their experience as &ldquo;skilled shoppers.&rdquo; Looking at the other side of the coin, why do men behave the way they do. Is there an explanation of why men will be men?? Studies highlight the role of testosterone. This hormone causes three problems for investors: It decreases fear, increases greed, and contributes to overconfidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With everything said above, let me warn you against stereotyping. I have come across men who are under confident and women who are fearless. &nbsp;Thus, being financially literate is a life skill for all. Financial awareness, knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour together determine the financial wellbeing of an individual. It is the cornerstone for making sound financial decisions and financial planning.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Women who lack financial competency face serious repercussions. For instance, when one loses the significant other and is clueless about what to do with the wealth, how to manage money. Worst of all, one might not know how much wealth is there to be managed. It becomes a daunting task for a financially illiterate person to manage credit card debt, loans, taxes, investments, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The situation, however, is not so dismal. There are signs of change, a change in the right direction. During the pandemic, the work-from-home structure has helped many women dedicate time to learning about different investment products at their convenience. Women have emerged as interested, committed, and knowledgeable investors &ndash; reflected in the increasing number of women accounts. Women have turned towards stock market trading to maintain their living standards and save more in these uncertain times. Many are first-time investors, some housewives. The general observation is that women investors are interested more in investing than trading.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Young women investors benefit from the plethora of online trading apps, video tutorials, and other information repositories. Rapid financial digitization and low brokerage charges have catalyzed the increased women&rsquo;s participation.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here&rsquo;s wishing you all a very Happy Women&rsquo;s Day!! And leaving you with a quick check about your level of financial awareness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Are you proactively aware of the stock market&rsquo;s direction at any given time?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do you know which financial instruments would help you achieve your financial goals?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you proceed in life, are you planning for financial independence?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And most importantly, would you want to make your investment decisions without anyone else&rsquo;s assistance whatsoever?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, if you are about to begin your financial empowerment journey, embrace the chaos; something will go wrong, anticipate it, deal with it. Keep your cool. Let your goal not be to be just rich/ wealthy but to be calm and comfortable, not just to retire but also to have financial freedom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Better, if you are financially empowered, continue to seed the desire to be financially literate in others, which is equally important. Now is the time to inspire others, remove barriers, build community, and empower women with the confidence and skills necessary to be financially equal and independent. Let&rsquo;s make finance conversations as common and straightforward as bread and butter (definitely not because women are not intelligent, but because it is an important topic to be missed!).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A special note to all the men who are reading this &ndash; I truly hope you educate and empower the women in your lives about independent financial planning. And to all the women reading this &ndash; I truly wish that shopping in the Dalal Street excites you as much as the Oxford Street!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687870937/jubqxhn6gd3ykkcekcqr.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Being Equal – Financially!","seo_keywords":"Being Equal – Financially!","seo_description":"Most of us visualize the finance world as predominantly male!!

Russia has begun military operations in Ukraine. My heart goes out to all those who are personally being affected by this geopolitical mayhem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Historical use of the term &ldquo;geopolitics&rdquo; expresses states&rsquo; practice to control and compete for territory. The risk of wars, coups, and other military clashes cannot but affect financial markets. When we witnessed Russian troops on Ukrainian borders, the markets globally tanked. Moscow Stock Exchange on Thursday suspended trading amid tensions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But now, the interconnectedness between countries and economies has made the world a global village. A war fought more than 5000 kms away has a sentimental impact on Indian markets too. Benchmark indices in Tokyo and South Korea fell 2%, and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3%. India&rsquo;s Volatility index surged past 30 per cent to a 20-month high. The very next day, the markets rebounded with clarity on the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Moreover, this geopolitical risk plays a vital role not only in equity but also in corporate bonds, treasuries, or currency markets. Thus, the world financial markets are experiencing extreme volatility on the investments front. The Indian market mirrored the global sentiment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nonetheless, while this invasion is devastating impacts on the humanitarian front, another question of interest from an investor&rsquo;s angle is how this geopolitical uncertainty holds for him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The warlike situation has spillovers to the energy market. Also, precious and rare metals like gold attract attention, especially in the context of their risk-hedging properties. One of the major concerns was the energy sector, which is not affected by the sanctions announced till now.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Oil prices after touching the peak of $100 are back below the mark (After all, after Saudi, Russia is the second-largest exporter of Oil and largest exporter of Natural Gas). Black Sea is an essential route in the global supply chain. Russia is one of the world&rsquo;s biggest suppliers of metals used in car manufacturing, such as nickel or palladium.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All in all, the cost of living would increase across the world, which is already witnessing rising inflation and interest rates, with the end of easy money while recovering from the pandemic. However, the situation remains fluid, but all these factors considered in conjunction with the Russia Ukraine tension would negatively impact living standards almost everywhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the Indian context, the impact is likely to be visible on sectors heavily dependent on imports in the current situation. Oil-producing companies, ONGC and Oil India, may find a place on investors&rsquo; radars. The same is true for the metal and chemical sectors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><em>&ldquo;The time to buy is when there&rsquo;s blood in the streets&rdquo;, used to say, Baron Rothschild, one of the wealthiest men of all time.</em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><em><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687871758/lerzwl1ewo9p4mmpkcih.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 684px;\" type=\"image\" /></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is worth remembering that the markets more often overreact to geopolitical risks. Estimating risks and probabilities, investors rely on various mental shortcuts or so-called heuristics to save time and effort. They tend to overweight certain types of information, underweight, or entirely ignore others. The easier an occurrence of some phenomenon comes to mind, the more probable it appears. In the present situation, broad media coverage, recency and emotional affect, for example, amplify subjective availability, increasing the estimated probability of an event.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Consequently, the changes in news sentiment may substantially affect the perceived risk and results of geopolitical events. This phenomenon appears to be particularly strong with fearsome risks, that is, those that stimulate strong emotional responses such as anxiety or fear. A surge in the news coverage of a military conflict or terrorist act nearby leads to an elevated subjective risk, exceeding the objective one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The change in perceived risk is accompanied by additional selling (buying) pressure as investors move their capital from riskier to safer markets, leading to price undershooting (overshooting) relative to the stock&rsquo;s fundamental value. Subsequently, the resulting mispricing is corrected via a price increase (decline) in the following period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let the investor in you look at the good in the bad news. Typically, foreign wars have a limited sustained impact on the economic growth trajectory and financial market. Take this market correction as an opportunity to invest. Continue the SIP/ STP in the dip, buy value picks with reasonable valuations, think long term and stay invested. Stay diversified and disciplined to your investment frequency. Don&rsquo;t panic; breathe slowly and think clearly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear readers, I would conclude with the words of Peter Lynch</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your investments as long as the fundamental story behind the same hasn&rsquo;t changed. People who succeed in the investing also accept periodic losses, setbacks, and unexpected occurrences.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687871842/dkrdpewyzlj5niik4jrq.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Financial Markets Buffeted by Russia Ukraine Crisis","seo_keywords":"Financial Markets Buffeted by Russia Ukraine Crisis","seo_description":"Historical use of the term “geopolitics” expresses states’ practice to control and compete for territory.

Of course, different people have different mindsets on how, when, where, and why they should shell out their financial resources. But for long-term financial success, you should think like an investor, never like a consumer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most people use their money for immediate gratification. That means spending money on new products, subscriptions, and services. Advertisements convince them that all these latest yet expensive gadgets and services will make them happy. But, they fail to realize that they don&rsquo;t need these latest, costly items to be satisfied in an absolute sense. Some people hesitate to calculate how much money they spend on these items they actually don&rsquo;t need, while others simply don&rsquo;t think there is another option to spend their money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, investors place more value on building long-term wealth than on the things that will give them immediate pleasure. The investor is a broader term not reserved for the 1% of the population or the people who possess expensive items. Income or net worth never differentiates consumers from investors. The defining factor that separates investors from the rest is their mindset.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In fact, you can start developing an investor mindset even before you have money to invest. Consciously or not, every one of us has gone through the learning curve of an investor mindset. During college days, no one would have looked far beyond the upcoming weekend, and most of us didn&rsquo;t set any long-term financial or personal goals. We spent a significant chunk of our money on things that didn&rsquo;t matter in the long run. We thought that saving and investing were reserved only for the older generation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, you would have noticed that after you made a conscious decision to do things differently, you began to see any sort of financial success in your life. This shift in mindset empowered us to establish ourselves in our careers, turn our savings into investments, and pursue side hustles of our choice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Everything changed when we began to think like an investor instead of consumers. So let&rsquo;s look at 5 mindset shifts that can help you do the same.</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Always Think About Growth</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A fixed mindset takes you nowhere. A closed mind and stagnant thought process might result from unfortunate past experiences or a lack of self-trust. On the other hand, a growth mindset constantly transforms a person over an upward trajectory as they will focus more on the future than the past while appreciating the present.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s begin by setting short-term and long-term financial goals, and the narrower, short-term goals should act as the building blocks for your broader, long-term goals. To achieve financial independence, we should set short-term goals such as saving money, purchasing real estate, and starting businesses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">People with a growth mindset are always comfortable with change, while people with fixed mindsets stay the same because they believe they possess limited talents, strengths, and weaknesses. Some fail to admit their weaknesses and never learn from their mistakes. People with growth mindsets take away these limiting thoughts from their minds and firmly believe that their decisions transpire their fate. They know that patience, knowledge, and effort will get them where they want to be.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Being in Control of Money</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor would always be in control of their money. Your income levels don&rsquo;t matter if you care about building long-term wealth and know how to budget. Investors make money to save it, and their savings are used for investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Consumers follow an &lsquo;easy come and easy go&rsquo; financial policy. As a result, they run behind in satisfying their &lsquo;wants&rsquo; than &lsquo;needs&rsquo; and crave the immediate gratification they get from mindless spending. So, this is why the people who make the most money never get into the wealthiest class. To put it simply, if you make ₹2,00,000 per year but spend ₹2,25,000 the same year, you are in debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors avoid this mistake by visibly organizing their finances to understand how they make and spend money. They use this information to make wiser investing decisions. They know avoiding immediate gratification attempts like vacations, and expensive purchases will grant them much more happiness later in life. This behavior, also known as delayed gratification, keeps them focused on their long-term and short-term financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Protect Your Time</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">24 hours a day is what investors and consumers have got in their lives. But they spend it differently, making them different from each other. The time spent on one thing leaves lesser time for something else. Investors know apart from their health, their time is the most valuable thing available to them, and they use it efficiently to reach their financial goals. They spend time getting better at something that makes them financially successful in the long run.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor mindset lets you see the link between money and time. To put it in another way, investors spend money on things that will save them time in the long run. So, a specific monthly subscription gives them more time to build up a side hustle; they will invest in it. In short, investors invest in things; they never buy things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other side, consumers don&rsquo;t care about their time (or their health) and choose to waste it on things that bring immediate gratification rather than saving money for delayed gratification.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Investors buy assets, not liabilities</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To understand the concept of assets and liabilities, remember that assets make money for you, and liabilities, on the other hand, take money away from you. Consumers shell out a significant chunk of their earnings on liabilities like cars, vacations, and expensive items that drain their pockets with no return. Instead, investors place Return on Investment (ROI) on top of their priority list and invest in real estate, stocks, and bonds that create a steady cash flow for them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. They Try to Beat Themselves, Not Others</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even though every one of us proclaims that we don&rsquo;t care what others think of us, we do care about it to some extent. But it is not the case with investors. They won&rsquo;t sacrifice their financial success to impress the outside world as they know looking rich and being really rich are entirely different concepts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The people who spend beyond their means just to look rich will pay for it later in life. Remember, people with expensive items are not the ones who always hold the biggest bank accounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Investor Mindset in a Nutshell</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor mindset brings the right balance between extravagance and frugality. The best way to teach an investor mindset is to determine what makes you happy. Investors only spend money on things they truly want. They know that shelling out money just to show off will take them down an endless debt hole. Instead of trying to impress others, focus on impressing yourself because, ultimately, that&rsquo;s the only thing that matters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687873912/osezqheqfllm9bniichm.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The 5 Mindset Shifts to Think Like an Investor","seo_keywords":"The 5 Mindset Shifts to Think Like an Investor","seo_description":"If you got a deep pocket, you never have a shortage of options to put a deep hole in it.

But, more than that, an investor can attain several benefits when they seek the assistance of a professional wealth manager. A few benefits are eliminating stress, streamlining the wealth management process, and offering personalized yet customized investment solutions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The dawn of the Digital Age imposed several limitations over the traditional wealth management process. Many conventional investment avenues have transformed contrary to our imaginations and expectations, failing to deliver the expected returns. Along with that, traditional investment platforms have also undergone tectonic shifts. An investor with no basic technical knowledge or the one who fails to widen the horizons of his learning may fail to keep up with the exponential penetration rate of technology into the investment arena.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, agriculture has embraced technology more significantly and reinvented itself as agricultural technology or the Agritech industry. Likewise, financial services utilize the latest technologies to automate and improve them as financial technology or Fintech services. Many financial solutions such as wealth management and tax planning experts adopt technology like never before. Do-it-yourself (DIY) investment solutions are becoming increasingly popular as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Digital technology and the internet are transforming the money management industry, and DIY investment platforms, without doubt, will change the way every investor manages their wealth. In this article, let us look at how the arena of wealth management adapts itself to the Digital Age.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Mobile Applications</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investor education is a crucial element in increasing the flow of investments. To educate investors, digital solutions can help wealth management firms to a more considerable extent. Towards that goal, Mobile applications, in particular, can be game-changers. To adapt to the ever-changing Digital Age conditions, wealth management services can roll out mobile applications that provide their clients with loads of helpful information such as financial news, investment advice, stock market live watch, and much more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Along with the educational aspect, wealth management firms could use a mobile application to help clients access digital platforms that facilitate easy investment solutions. For example, Coin, a mobile application by Zerodha, an established discount stockbroking firm in India, turns mutual funds investing into a simple and straightforward process even for layman investors. Using the application, an investor can also invest directly in top-rated mutual funds through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) or any of his convenient plans. Another mobile application named Moneyfy from Tata Capital allows investors to compare various mutual funds. It also helps to invest directly in liquid funds, gold funds, thematic funds, and tax-saver funds that could meet an investor&rsquo;s financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Digital Tools</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Documentation takes a considerable chunk of the initial phase of wealth management. Those tedious procedures consist of collecting details, Know Your Customer (KYC) documentation, and taking care of other standard protocols. All these bring considerable delays to the core process of wealth management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealth managers can implement technology-based automation to streamline these repetitive procedures and simplify every other aspect of financial services. Managers can spend this saved time and energy on offering financial advice and adding value to their clients as soon as they enter into the wealth management service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Robo-advisors &ndash; digital entities that give out automated, algorithm-driven financial advisory services with little to no human intervention &ndash; also hold a lot of promise to the wealth management arena in the Digital Age. They can also cut costs significantly, turning digital wealth management affordable and accessible to a broader section of investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Technology-Based Risk Management</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Risk management is crucial for investing, trading, and wealth management. However, risk management always plays against human psychology, and managing risk manually brings more trouble during the process. It can be tedious, time-consuming, and often prone to mistakes. Digital DIY investment applications can help an investor or a wealth manager in this crucial area of investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Automation using computer technology is a great way to ward off human errors from any area of human interest. Financial services are no different. For example, automated risk management solutions can give wealth managers early warning signs about investment risks or credit defaults. Digital tools can also be deployed to run simulations of various risk-reward scenarios. Then, investors can make more informed decisions about managing and growing their wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Digitization</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">No two investors have the same financial plans, financial goals, or investment requirements. Digital money management solutions can help professionals identify each investor&rsquo;s financial goals and needs and devise personalized investment strategies accordingly. For instance, digital tools can assess an investor&rsquo;s risk appetite, the nature of financial plans and goals, the size of the existing portfolio, and expectations of returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Armed with all this detailed information, wealth managers can provide personalized investment services to each client and motivate themselves to upgrade the quality of their wealth management services. Therefore, digitization paves the way for increased personalization of wealth management services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Digitalization in investment brings various challenges to the older generation but investing turns out to be an easier task for Millennial and Generation Z (Gen Z) investors. It is because they are more tech-savvy than the older generation. As a result, they can also benefit significantly from digital and automated investment solutions. This Millennial and Gen Z constitutes the central part of the investor population in the coming days, and wealth management firms benefit from them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Digital Age can also be taken as a Golden Age of investing as more people will get into the arena of investing and trading as the number of DIY investors increases and self-directed investment platforms gain popularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealth management services attain benefits in many ways by adapting themselves to the Digital Age. Along with the increasing use of digitization, many positive developments have already been in the wealth management arena. Social media support, gamification, and stock market tracking software, are among the few positive outcomes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687929913/knk3ckrzxpvk9flos2v4.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How can Money Management Adapt to the Digital Era?","seo_keywords":"How can Money Management Adapt to the Digital Era?","seo_description":"Wealth management is the proven way to compound the hard-earned money of novel and seasoned investors with a long-term financial plan.

The colour&nbsp;red&nbsp;took over the Monday blues when we celebrated Valentine&rsquo;s day with our loved ones.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the Indian setting, no one can deny the love for gold. Buying gold is a tradition for Indians that never seems to fade. At least a little bit of the yellow metal can be found in almost every Indian portfolio in physical or paper form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This love for gold is not only for the&nbsp;aam aadmi, but our central banks seem to be captivated by the charm of this yellow metal. RBI is the 2nd largest buyer globally. RBI mopped up 77.5 metric tons of gold in 2021, its second highest ever after 2009 when it bought 200 metric tons from the International Monetary Fund. Falling gold prices have contributed to this shopping spree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In times of uncertainty, the price of gold moves north. Since 2021, the economic turmoil is settling down, and the economic growth is picking up, leading to a consistent price decline of gold in 2021.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2022, as we expect an inflationary period, RBI aims to increase its gold reserves, balancing out the weakening in major currencies, including the U.S. dollar. This weakness in the prices has a detrimental impact on the current account balance of a commodity-importing nation like India, which can be countered by raising gold reserves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The next logical question would be &ndash; Is RBI alone in this? Interestingly, the answer is NO.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687930015/xh08ykhngl1orbaowi67.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 1284px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All central banks like to keep a fraction of their reserves as gold, as it acts as a hedge during uncertain times, like the ones we are witnessing at present.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to the Goldhub report published in January, Central banks across the world collectively bought 463 tonnes of gold in 2021, a significant rebound in demand from central banks following the decade low of 255 metric tonnes in 2020. 2021 was the twelfth successive year of net purchases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2021, The Central Bank of Thailand topped the buyer&rsquo;s list with 90 tonnes. Hungary tripled its gold reserves by buying 63 tonnes over the year. Brazil bought 62 tonnes, while Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan added 30 tonnes and 15 tonnes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The primary reasons why central banks like gold is because of liquidity, intrinsic value, and lack of credit risk. Gold has seen strong support from the consumer and central bank demand and its performance this year indeed underscored the value of its unique dual nature and the diverse demand drivers. The tug of war between persistent inflation and rising rates created a mixed picture for demand on the investment side.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The chart below depicts the movement in the average price of gold (per 10 gm). Though gold is a great hedge against inflation and is recommended for partial diversification in the portfolio, the returns underperform substantially as compared to equities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687930045/adfczq777vbxzcqu94ll.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 487px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All major central banks have parked a substantial amount of their foreign currency reserves in gold. In the current global economic environment where most economies are facing unprecedented inflation, the pandemic abatement is uncertain, you may feel the urge to add gold in the portfolio at appropriate times.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It need not be physical gold or jewellery for your loved ones, with the option of sovereign gold bonds and digital gold being now available, you may start investing in smaller amounts as well without worrying about any physical storage. Sovereign gold bonds seem to be best option as a fixed 2.5% coupon is also assured.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, since the returns are way lower as compared to equities, do not binge on the bling! Though a &lsquo;valuable&rsquo; addition to your portfolio, add in small proportions, may be, while keep a major part tilted towards equities for long run returns!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687930136/o2gam4dyh4wkd9z5m42i.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Love for Bling!","seo_keywords":"The Love for Bling!","seo_description":"In the Indian setting, no one can deny the love for gold.

For instance, Ola&rsquo;s (an Indian ridesharing company) undertaking to open another headquarters in Sydney, Australia, can be taken as bringing FDI into Australia. Reinvestment of profits from overseas business operations and intra-organizational loans and borrowings to overseas subsidiaries also come under FDI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The scope of FDI is not limited to the transnational flow of capital. It also includes the transnational movement of economic elements similar to capital, such as human skills, technology, and business processes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, there is a significant difference between FDI and FPI. FPI or Foreign Portfolio Investments means the purchasing of equity of international companies. In short, FPI includes only equity infusion rather than the establishment of &lsquo;lasting interest.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FDI can be both Greenfield and Brownfield in acquiring &lsquo;lasting interest.&rsquo; In Greenfield FDI, an enterprise creates its subsidiary in another country and builds its business operations from the bottom up. Through Brownfield FDI, a business organization expands its business operations through transnational mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures by leasing or purchasing existing production facilities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here we point out the top nine ways foreign direct investments benefit the nation that attracts FDI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. Boosts Employment and Economic Growth</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The creation of employment is the most valuable advantage of FDI. It is also one of the significant reasons a nation, particularly a developing one, strives to attract FDI from other countries. FDI also boosts the manufacturing and the services sectors of a nation. Along with creating more jobs, FDI also helps reduce unemployment among the educated youth and creates more working opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. Increased employment translates to enhanced incomes, purchasing power, and increased tax revenue for the government, boosting a country&rsquo;s overall economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. The Development of Human Resources</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Human resources development is one of the less obvious and often understated advantages of FDI. In simpler terms, it refers to a country&rsquo;s workforce&rsquo;s knowledge, skills, and competence. Human resource development can be efficiently carried out through education, training, and experience. Moreover, once developed and honed, human resources are mobile as they can train the same in other companies, creating a ripple effect.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Development of the Backward Areas of a Country</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FDI is powerful enough to transform the backward areas of a developing nation into income-creating yet employment-generating industrial centers. This process, in turn, positively influences the socio-economic situations of the regions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Access to Latest Technology and Funds</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The business that receives FDI also gets access to the latest technologies, operational business practices, and funds from various sources worldwide. Eventually, the infusion of the latest, enhanced technologies and methods result in their assimilation into the local economy, resulting in improved efficiency in production and distribution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Enhanced Exports</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Not all goods and services produced in an industry supported by FDI are for domestic consumption. In addition, most of these products and services have global demand for sheer economic reasons. Moreover, creating Export Oriented Units (EOUs) and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) further assist FDI investors in boosting their export-import operations from other countries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. The Stability of Currency Exchange Rate</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The constant flow of FDI into a nation boosts the nation&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves. It helps the country&rsquo;s central bank maintain a balanced reserve of foreign exchange and ensures stable currency exchange rates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>7. Stimulates Grass-Root Level Economic Development</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from being a great source of capital inflows and higher revenues for a country, FDI brings grass-root level economic development. It is another understated advantage of FDI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For instance, the construction of factories and other industrial physical structures use local labor, materials, and equipment. Once the construction is over, the factory will employ more local people and utilize local materials and services further. These additional jobs in a local community enhance their purchasing power and increase tax revenue for the government. And, the government can utilize the increased income to improve infrastructure and create additional jobs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>8. Enhanced Capital Flow</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most countries across the world have unbalanced economic structures. FDI facilitates the sharing of resources among nations with mutual benefits. FDI generates more capital inflow to a country and helps the countries with limited domestic resources. Similarly, the countries with limited opportunities to raise funds in global capital markets can lean on FDI for economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>9. Develops a Competitive Market</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FDI facilitates the entry of international companies into the domestic marketplace, thereby developing a competitive marketplace by breaking domestic business monopolies. A healthy competitive marketplace compels companies to continuously enhance their products and services, decrease prices, and foster innovation. It also welcomes consumers into a market that has a broader range of competitively innovative yet low-priced products and services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For instance, a multinational corporation ventures into FDI in India to access new markets and industrial space where the corporation can expand its business operations, thereby boosting its global market influence. In addition, FDI allows the company to access limited natural resources such as fossil fuels and precious metals and other assets such as labor, management expertise, and technologies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are two more ways FDI can benefit a business organization. Firstly, it helps a business organization to lower its cost of production. A company can access cheaper natural and human resources by dealing directly with the source of raw materials rather than purchasing them from third parties. Secondly, a company that undertakes FDI operations can avail various tax benefits. The tax advantages occur only if the country that sponsors FDI allows a tax deduction on foreign revenue or when the beneficiary country allows tax deductions and benefits for companies attracting FDI in that country. Additionally, all these tax benefits become a reality if the beneficiary country has more beneficial tax regulations than the country that sponsors FDI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687930966/gf69xuc2rlphtaaitqff.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Top Nine Benefits of Foreign Direct Investment","seo_keywords":"Top Nine Benefits of Foreign Direct Investment","seo_description":"Foreign Direct Investment, popularly known as FDI, is the investment by a business organization from one country into another to establish ‘lasting interest.’ The term ‘lasting interest’ means acquiring a minimum of 10% of voting rights in another business organization.

Besides, they never shy away from filling their portfolio with these never-ending love affairs.&nbsp; A portfolio based on bedtime grandma stories and traditional investment assets do not, and cannot, generate returns that could, at least, beat the rate of inflation. Unfortunately, millions of Indian families possess portfolios with poor asset allocation. That also means millions of Indians are heading towards their retirement with depleted portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report in 2017 stands as the proof for the above-mentioned fact. The &lsquo;Indian Household Finance Survey&rsquo; by RBI published in July 2017 highlighted that the average Indian household holds nearly 84% of its wealth in real estate and other physical assets, roughly 11% in gold and other precious metals, and a meager 5% in financial assets. Even at the creamy layer of wealth distribution, retirement investing plays a very limited role in the balance sheets of Indian households. &nbsp;The report also states that households in advanced economies hold substantially more financial assets than their Indian counterparts. They are more likely to finance home purchasing with a mortgage and hold a major part of their wealth in retirement funds throughout their lifetime.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although the RBI survey revealed shocking statistics, the reality is much worse. Most Indians, including affluent Indian High Networth Individuals (HNIs), have allocated over 95% of their wealth to assets that fail to generate a real rate of return. Those assets include gold, real estate, substandard debt mutual funds, and low-quality stocks. Therefore, the situation is turning grim for a generation of Indians, who began working in the early 1980s and waiting to retire in the next ten years, set to struggle mightily through their retirement phase of life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is important to take note of how this financial disaster takes place and at the same time, it is vital to mitigate the financial ruins these disasters are about to bring in millions of Indian HNI families and businesses. Towards both ends, this write-up should deflate a few of the Indian investing myths that have been wreaking havoc on the financial wellbeing of Indians for generations.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Myth 1: Gold is the Protector of Wealth</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Well, in India, gold can be a reliable store of value because the gold&rsquo;s price in terms of Indian rupees has compounded at 5 percent annually over the last 30 years. This return is broadly on a par with the prevalent rate of Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) in the country. But as far as increasing your wealth is concerned, gold is not an asset to look out for. The record of gold&rsquo;s price over the past three decades shows that it could generate returns below the rate of inflation. Between March 1990 to March 2000 gold prices fell 2.7 percent per annum and it witnessed a price rise of a meager 3.5 percent between March 2010 to March 2020.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Well, gold cannot augment your wealth materially after taking into account the rate of inflation. But, will it ever improve the risk-reward ratio in an Indian HNI&rsquo;s portfolio? In other words, will it help Indian investors to diversify their portfolios?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An effective diversifying asset should possess zero or negative correlation to the markets like NIFTY or Sensex. If we analyze the yearly change in prices of gold and Sensex in terms of each month from March 1990 to March 2020, we can easily find out that the two assets have a positive correlation of 12 percent. This price analysis might ring a bell or two to those who consider gold as a &lsquo;safe-haven asset&rsquo;, especially when stock markets or specific stocks are under pressure. Even during the 2008 financial crisis and the Corona panic from February to April 2020, gold and the Indian stock markets keep up their positive correlation. A simple price chart analysis of both assets during that period can validate this fact.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Myth 2: Real Estate Can Grow My Wealth</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Real estate investments are not worth the price and the risk. There are three major reasons to back that fact as well. Firstly, over the past five years, the returns of real estate properties even in metropolitan cities in India such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore have been roughly around 3-4% per annum &ndash; a rate of return that can easily be eaten away by current CPI. Secondly, the current home loan interest rate in India stands at 7.5%. Therefore, investing in an asset that yields a meager 3-4 percent on a 7.5% interest rate is not a wise investment decision. Thirdly, there is no point in comparing Indian residential rental yields with the same in other countries. Setting aside the affordability factor, countries like Singapore and USA offer real estate finance at an interest rate of 2-3%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Myth 3: Debt Mutual Funds Offer Better Returns with Low Volatility</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Debt mutual funds indeed offer better returns with low volatility. But, in India, the problem arises from the salesmen who earn a living by selling mutual funds. They have popularized the idea that mutual funds are the right investment class (with market-beating returns) for HNIs. Despite the news of the poor performance of even prominent mutual funds, the intermediaries continue to sell such products successfully. Why?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The blame should be placed on the reluctance of the investors to analyze and validate the right mutual fund for themselves. An investor should invest some time to analyze the Yield to Maturity (YTM), Mark to Market (MTM), and Expense Ratio, the factors that determine the return of a mutual fund. A little bit of time and effort spent on analyzing these factors and overall market conditions can help an investor to pick out the mutual funds that offer better returns with low volatility from high-risk, sub-standard funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Myth 4: I Can Time the Stock Market</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">No one can either time the stock market or the economic cycles. Besides, contrary to popular Indian notion, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth never drives the stock market. Most of the investors give a portion of their wealth (or all of it) to an investment analyst in the hope that the analyst can perfectly time the market or the economy. And in most cases, the hope never gets fulfilled. In truth, stock markets are more or less a reflector of the collective investor psychology that may act as a predictor of GDP growth. The economic cycles or GDP growth seldom play a role in equity market returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Consistent Compounding Approach Is the Key</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, we have debunked the major myths surrounding Indian investing. Now is the time to reveal some investment methods that work. We have already mentioned investing a good amount of time and effort before embarking on an investment journey. Choosing a genuine investment analyst who makes a living on fees and a share of profits can do wonders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another way to generate significant returns is by investing in a consistent manner. This means, investing in high-quality yet well-managed Indian companies that sell essential products and services with little market competition or behind a strong economic moat. This is also known as the Consistent Compounding approach, an investing approach that works, both in theory and in practice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687931370/rtkl2j6ky6pzdwzlaauq.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Knocking the Bottom Out of a Few Common Indian Investing Myths","seo_keywords":"Knocking the Bottom Out of a Few Common Indian Investing Myths","seo_description":"For generations, Indians have been in love with their past, traditions, folklore, and fairytales.

An HNI is made to feel that they deserve something special because of their unique financial status and never-ending cash flow. As a result, fund managers, financial advisors, and agents flock to them to offer that special treatment that they deserve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Are all the investment choices rolled out before an HNI worth investing in? Or are these fund managers help them to make the right investment decisions at the right time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Challenges are aplenty in the arena of HNI investing. In this article, first, we point out some of the main problems HNIs face when they embark on investing their hard-earned wealth. After that, we also suggest a few ways to deal with them effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Lack of Time</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Time, in a true sense, is more valuable than money. An HNI knows it better than anyone. But, unfortunately, when it comes to investing, an HNI possesses a vast amount of wealth but only a little time at their disposal. The reason is most of them are occupied with their careers or businesses, the primary source of their income.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Learning is an essential element in investing. Unfortunately, most HNIs face a dearth of time to read books, blogs, or magazines and make investment decisions on their own. As a result, they have to depend heavily on their financial advisors and often hire multiple financial advisors to implement asset diversification, cross-check the available information, and take a second opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Plethora of Choices</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An HNI is a spoilt brat of investment choices. Like bees, financial advisors flock to them with investment plans and ideas. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP), Portfolio Management Service (PMS) or Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), or any other fancy investments; some are lucky enough to sell them to an HNI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many HNIs are also at the mercy of the bank&rsquo;s Relationship Managers (RM), who has access to their account information. So, an RM could easily push different financial products even to a risk-averse HNI. A banking fund, services fund, or debt fund, you name it, and, in most cases, an HNI portfolio has it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Larger Capital Corpus</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The vast capital corpus with an HNI can lead to confusion, indecision, and miscalculated investments. For instance, an HNI portfolio with a deep pocket invites dozens of investment assets. As a result, it may contain Mutual Funds or Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) that don&rsquo;t sync with their investing style or never benefits diversification or meet their financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The HNI investment attitude would be: &ldquo;As I have more money with me, I need more funds to invest in.&rdquo; Consequently, every new investment asset has a special place in a rich HNI portfolio, and most of them remain as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Lack of Financial Planning</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An HNI play golfs, parties and rubs shoulders with high-profile investors or bankers. Those interactions bring many &lsquo;tips&rsquo; regarding the next rise or big fall in the stock markets, Brexit, FIIs, interest rate, or even the next move of the RBI governor. So the next thing an HNI would do is to pick up their phone and call their advisor to share the &lsquo;tips&rsquo; and ask whether they should book profit or create a new position in the markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial planning takes a back seat under the influence of mindless &lsquo;tips&rsquo; and opinions. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s just grow my money, no matter what&rsquo; would be the new motto, the one that would most likely fail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Infallible Love for Traditional Investment Assets</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs love traditional investment assets like gold, PMS, and real estate. This blind love for traditional investments keeps them away from new-age investment vehicles like Mutual Funds, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT). These new classes of financial products can help HNIs manage their portfolios flexibly and generate a steady flow of income. Instead, HNIs pay exorbitant money management fees and share profits (if any) with a PMS. Or they keep pouring money into real estate, an illiquid asset that seems to be a safe investment avenue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Every Problem Has A Solution</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here, let&rsquo;s look at some of the solutions to tackle the HNI investment dilemmas you have seen above. An HNI can have a much simpler life with better returns from their investments. If you are an HNI, take a look at what you can do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Before you invest your hard-earned wealth, invest some time to research and analyze markets and investment avenues with the backing of meticulous goal-based financial planning.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conduct a thorough investigation when you go for picking up an investment advisor. You should preferably select an investment advisor who charges you a fee than the one who looks for a commission from selling financial products. The latter is a distributor, not an investment advisor.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Banks are meant to meet your banking needs, not your investment needs. The RM at your bank is rarely your investment advisor but an agent who has targets to meet and commissions to earn.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Never go for investing in a financial product or asset just because they are offered to you. Novelty is never a guarantee for higher returns. If you don&rsquo;t understand a financial product, don&rsquo;t buy it.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Patience always pays in investing. So, take some rest and sleep before you invest in anything.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Taxes hurt. Most traditional financial products and schemes like Fixed Deposits (FDs) come with a bigger tax burden. Therefore, never shy away from Tax-free bonds and Mutual Funds.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The right fee for the right investment advisor is always worth the price and the risk.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>It&rsquo;s Time for A &lsquo;Tip&rsquo;!</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ask any successful financial advisor, and they would tell that real investment management is a boring undertaking. It takes enormous courage, patience, and research to make the money work for you. But honestly speaking, if you are courageous and proactive enough to take charge of your investments, you can watch all these investment dilemmas vanishing into oblivion. Nobody, especially HNIs, is given money on a platter. So, never give it away easily.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687932143/oeitllynjk6qjedle07u.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How to Deal with HNI Investment Problems","seo_keywords":"How to Deal with HNI Investment Problems","seo_description":"The investment path of a High Networth Individual (HNI) is not as rosy as it seems.

From business titans and new-age entrepreneurs who compound their wealth to ultrarich professionals who earn six-digit paychecks around their high in-demand skills, one thing is sure: these HNIs are of a unique kind. And it would be somewhat simplifying to assert that HNIs invest their wealth in the same way, although we find something analogous in their investment endeavors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to changing investor behaviors and market conditions, local and global wealth management industries are undergoing tectonic shifts. Consequently, a one-dimensional private wealth management approach no longer satiates HNIs. Beyond meticulous asset allocation, they seek financial advisors who can provide technology-oriented, holistic investment solutions that span a broad spectrum of financial services. The Financial services focus on wealth preservation, estate planning and tax planning, portfolio diversification, alternative investments, and philanthropy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although HNI wealth management will always remain a &lsquo;customer-centric&rsquo; business, digital financial services are set to influence HNI wealth management models in the coming days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The New-Age Source of HNI Wealth</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Despite fat corporate salaries, most Indian HNIs tend to be business owners. Therefore, the sources of HNI wealth constitute more of a mixture of both inheritances within business families and newly generated wealth by entrepreneurs and professionals. It has been observed that the younger first-generation Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) are risk-takers skilled enough to grow their wealth without losing it. They have built their wealth through risky business ventures, so they are open to new emerging investment ideas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, the Indian investment climate is transforming, and as a result, liquidity is improving. Therefore, the valuations for their businesses are impressively increasing, leading to an unprecedented capital inflow into HNI wealth management firms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is the dawn of the age of entrepreneurs and start-ups. Once new-age HNI entrepreneurs exit their start-ups, a significant chunk of their investment is primarily utilized for incubating new businesses. A few HNI wealth management firms help the entrepreneurs deal with this transition aligning their investment strategies with their cash flow requirements and adding value to the whole process. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Paradigm Shift in HNI Investing</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Over the last decade, wealth management experts have observed clear-cut shifts in investing behavior of Ultra HNIs. They have shifted their focus to investing in segments such as distressed assets, infrastructure, and structured credit. They also began to accept leverage in their portfolios. Another trend is the willingness of ultra HNI investors to educate themselves on the investment decision-making process and the change in the evaluation metrics involved in structuring their portfolios.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The cash-flow and lifestyle requirements of HNIs have changed, so do the need for customization and asset allocation in their portfolios. The new trends in the Indian investment sphere &ndash; philanthropy and ESG (environment, social, and governance) investing &ndash; have gained popularity among HNIs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the noteworthy shifts in the HNI investment approach is their change of focus from &lsquo;timing the market&rsquo; to &lsquo;long term wealth building.&rsquo; In other words, their investment strategy has evolved from chasing short-term opportunities towards systemically preserving and growing their wealth. As a result, HNIs are now open to new investing ideas and take them up only if they fit in well with their long-term financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This change of investment perspective of HNIs quietly created the demand for a new asset class: seed capital investments, pre-Initial Public Offering (pre-IPO) investments, and growth capital investments. Mainly, HNIs with specialized knowledge in a particular domain, such as e-commerce or FinTech, have made their businesses successful, looking forward to supporting new investment ideas with their money and mentorship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A significant surge in HNI interest towards pre-IPOs and IPOs turned the allocations into quality IPOs into a difficult one owing to higher subscription levels. Therefore, HNIs take the route of Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) that either take positions at the pre-IPO stages or through the Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) or Anchor categories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many Wealth Management firms are rapidly ramping up their capabilities to tap this opportunity. They are building professional investment teams who can advise and guide HNIs on early-stage investing, Venture Capital (VC) funds or start-ups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Once the darling of the HNI community, real estate is losing its sheen and attracts little or no fresh investments from HNIs. The demonetization in 2016 and the launch of Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) also exacerbated the process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&lsquo;Boring&rsquo; Vanilla Or &lsquo;Risky&rsquo; Exotic?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do HNIs more inclined towards investing in &lsquo;risky&rsquo; exotic investments rather than &lsquo;boring&rsquo; vanilla investments such as Fixed Deposits? Indian HNIs have a mixed approach: the older HNI generation prefers the relative comfort of traditional investment avenues, while new-age HNIs go for alternative assets that satisfy their appetite for relatively higher risks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs are in hot pursuit of financial advisers with fresh investment ideas &mdash; a call for investment advisors with entrepreneurial aspirations. Theme-based Portfolio Management Services (PMS) have also attracted much interest from HNIs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Wrapping It Up</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Industry experts believe that the Indian market remains traditional for HNI investments. However, the Indian market requires a significant transformation in its depth and breadth to meet the new investor demands. Global best investment practices need to be adapted to the Indian context. In addition, more varied investment avenues need to be created to accommodate the burgeoning levels of HNI wealth and their steadily rising appetite for alternative investment classes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, a country prone to inflation and currency shocks, a more incredible opportunity exists to create financial products around those risks. Moreover, as common investors mature, higher demand for yield-based and inflation protection financial products emerge in India as it did in Western economies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian HNI wealth management industry is set for its next growth phase. A collective digitalization effort, the adaptation to changing investor behaviors, the introduction of more value-creating investment avenues ranging from early-stage investment vehicles to philanthropic and ESG will culminate in a &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; investing experience for its HNI clientele.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Exciting times lie ahead for the wealth management business. Still, it would be sadful to watch wealth managers with traditional business models largely disappearing from the market in the coming days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687934606/dc37pp8zbanxblrzo8rc.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Secrets of HNI Investing","seo_keywords":"The Secrets of HNI Investing","seo_description":"One of the few things that arouse the interest of common investors is how (and where) ultra-rich High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) invest their boundless wealth.

With crores of investors wealth eroding in a few minutes, Dec 2021 is turning out to be quite a conclusion to the already eventful year 2021.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When the market corrected, it gave a jolt to the &lsquo;<strong>perpetual motion machine&rsquo;</strong>, a notion that financial innovations and the concept that&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;this time, it is different&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;could increase accelerated wealth.&nbsp;However exciting it may sound, this&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;perpetual motion machine&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>violates the fundamental laws of physics.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, it is an impossible dream for an economy growing at a nominal growth rate of 10% to 12% to offer a universal profit of 15-20% per year. It violates the simple mathematical rule that the overall wealth growth rate equates to the economy&rsquo;s growth rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nonetheless, some sectors like digital can exhibit transient accelerated growth due to innovations and discoveries. In the end, global wealth appreciation has to equal GDP growth. The challenge is often to accept the losses and realize that the previous gains were not real but were inflated values</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687934209/cc4bob2x7enf1d7bg7zr.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 764px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The time evokes memories of the 1929 stock market crash and the dot-com bubble.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Americans participated in the stock market with borrowed money leading to an astronomical rise before the crash &ndash; The great depression. Rising prices created a positive feedback loop, encouraging people to continue to invest more and more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the dawn of the millennium, the belief that the Internet and the knowledge economy has the power to transform both society and productive possibilities fundamentally gained tremendous ground.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In its most extreme form, it was a belief imagining a kind of &ldquo;digital sublime&rdquo; that promised almost unlimited wealth. A strong bull market in the 1990s existed, particularly for technology stocks. Investors allocated a higher percentage to such shares and invested in riskier (often technology) companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The bubble and crash were apparent in the case of technology stocks. The NASDAQ index rose more than six-fold between 1995 and early 2000 and lost more than three-quarters of its peak value by late 2002.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687934238/nf7umhk66zs3vcbgyacq.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 749px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Robert Shiller described the psychology of the market in late 1990 in terms of irrational exuberance. Though the firm&rsquo;s current earnings did not seem to be a valid basis for high stock prices, investors thought future earnings would grow at rapid rates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The internet stocks attained celebrity status, with their prices exceeding intrinsic value, similar to the celebrities who earn more than the individuals&rsquo; talent, owing to a strong emotional dimension.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Just as the media promotes celebs, it glamorizes investing/ stock market trading. Familiarity heuristic led people to prefer to invest in things they think they know and understand. Many people began to use the Internet during the internet stock bubble, which felt familiar to them. The Internet appeared to offer immense potential. Conceivably, internet stocks came to be seen as exciting investments with huge potential by association with the Internet itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After stock price increases, the investors are less risk-averse because prior gains cushion subsequent losses. The result is higher volatility in stock prices. Changes in attitudes towards risk significantly affect asset valuation and price changes. Risk aversion among investors increases after stock prices fall, which reinforces the drop in prices</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Momentum played a significant role too. The investors were divided into fundamentalists (price traders) and trend followers (herd traders). The fundamentalists believed in the mean-reversion of stock prices towards a true (fundamental) value. Any deviation from the true value would be corrected. The herd traders thought that a direction of price movement would continue. The number of investors in the two groups varies over time. Before the market falls, the proportion of trend followers often exceeds the fundamentalists.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In addition, herding is often rationalized based on the &ldquo;new economy&rdquo;, new &ldquo;real option&rdquo; valuation. Moreover, a sense of safety of numbers &ndash; everyone cannot be wrong, offers comfort to the investors. Evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics inform us that herding is one of the unavoidable consequences of our most potent cognitive ability, that is, imitation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The increasing sheer complexity makes calibration of the risks from past data very difficult. In addition, the greater the complexity, the more considerable the variability in risk estimations. In other words, greater complexity introduces a substantial sensitivity to model errors, analogous to the greater sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems. In a way, it is virtually impossible to put a valuation ceiling on the Cryptocurrency, NFTs, New age economy stocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When reason becomes secondary to feelings, psychic realities govern the investment decisions. Wishful perception clouds the reality to accommodate what people want to see. This disapproval of the unpleasant truth diminishes the learning ability. I don&rsquo;t want to sound like a pessimist but a realist.

As a result, implementing risk mitigation strategies in the current macroeconomic conditions has become quite challenging. Most cautious were those who invested large amounts of funds &ndash; primarily, High Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) &ndash; in various investment classes. It is because they are vulnerable to losing a large chunk of their wealth in a more likely event of downside.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The lockdown and pandemic haven&rsquo;t transformed the investment strategies but what has changed is the aspirations, needs, and ambitions of many investors. Anyway, the current investment environment is transforming for the better amidst unforeseen challenges, which, in turn, are ushering in new investment opportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The seven essential HNI investing trends to watch for in 2022 are as follows.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">A Calculated Expansion of Equity Exposure</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The stock markets worldwide are hitting new heights for the past year, and a positive yet cautious outlook prevails among HNIs. Some conventional investors continue to cover large-cap stocks with a positive long-term outlook. Stocks of the businesses that will benefit from a turn in the economic cycle are also potential equity investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now, the strong fundamentals of a business have regained relevance in the stock-picking process. Hence, investors should prefer an investor should prefer high-quality stocks trading at reasonable valuations for investment in the current economic scenario.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An increased influx of funds is coming into an overheated equity market, which is why HNIs continue to keep a cautious exposure into it. However, as global interest rates are abysmally low, investors should shift the focus of equity investment from short-term returns to a long-term perspective.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">ETFs and Index Funds</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Index Funds were here for a while as smart equity investment options without worrying much about the volatility of the equity markets. However, today, the pandemic-induced uncertainty in the investment arena turned it into a new sensation, particularly among millennials of HNI and Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNI).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Portfolio Management Service and Alternative Investment Funds</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Portfolio Management Service (PMS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) are back on track along with the bulls in the stock market. PMS and AIF have highly qualified fund managers to privately manage your portfolio and generate alpha while safeguarding your overall wealth. AIFs are gaining popularity among HNIS, and the industry witnessed a growth of 27% in Assets Under Management &nbsp;(AUM) in the last year. AIFs also tap into unique investment opportunities like venture capital funds, angel investing, real estate, long-only funds, and unlisted markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Focus on Sustainable Development Goals</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many businesses have failed to sustain the impact of the current Corona pandemic. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have gained prominence since then. Investors have shifted their focus on Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and are constantly on the lookout for companies with solid Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Companies with a robust SDG framework are highly resilient and can withstand sudden economic shocks. Moreover, the funds these companies allocate for social and environmental benefits will transform into long-term value creation for the shareholders in the company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, ESG is still in the nascent stage. Standardized reporting and data representation are required to conduct practical data analysis. However, economic Times&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/inflows-in-sustainable-funds-surge-76-to-rs-3686-cr-in-fy21/articleshow/82197389.cms?from=mdr\">reports</a>&nbsp;that the total investment inflow in ESG funds surged by 76% last year, and the size of Indian ESG funds as of March 2021 stands at roughly ₹10,000 crores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Technological Transformation in Industrial Sectors</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">CoVID pandemic has taught many businesses that leveraging technology helps them boost profits and smoothly run their business operations even during these tumultuous times. As a result, most companies all over the globe accelerated their digital transformation process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This tech-based business transformation opens more excellent investment opportunities for HNIs. They primarily participate in those opportunities either through publicly traded stocks or through Private Equity (PE) investments. FinTech, AgriTech, EduTech, and PharmaTech are among the few industrial sectors embracing technology on a broader scale and have fetched investor focus over the past few years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>6. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Gold: A Stable Investment yet A Hedge</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even in today&rsquo;s Digital Age, gold remains one of the most sought-after assets. Along with offering stability to your overall portfolio, gold can also be taken as an asset to achieve your long-term financial goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from buying physical gold, there are plenty of alternative means to invest in gold, such as gold ETFs, gold mutual funds, sovereign gold bonds. These digital derivatives of gold bear lower taxes and are free from other expenses like brokerage and locker fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gold, also termed as the haven of investments, preserves the value of your hard-earned money even during uncertain economic conditions. Even when equity, debt, currency, and commodity markets face a downturn, gold prices tend to remain stable or even gain. Gold is also an excellent hedge against inflation. In 2022, more investments can happen in the arena of gold and its derivatives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>7. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Real Estate Exposure Through REITs</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs preferred direct real estate investments in the past even though it calls for higher allocation of funds, massive paperwork, maintenance, taxes, and other costs. However, digital technology brought a paradigm shift in HNIs&rsquo; preferred investment avenue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Buying a house or financing one is an investment tactic of a bygone era. Instead, investing in commercial properties yields a stable revenue from rentals. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), a New Age investment class, enables commercial real estate exposure with much lesser funds, taxes, and paperwork. These features turn REIT into an attractive investment alternative to physical real estate investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs can also check out philanthropic investments that can save a great deal of taxes, and if you are an entrepreneur, it can boost the brand value of your enterprise. Over the past few years, the overall HNI outlook on investments has changed significantly. While the whole world is recovering from the impact of the Corona pandemic, the investment world is brimming with new investment opportunities, and HNIs are eagerly waiting to embrace such opportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687934862/rwpddmeddap66a4md4j9.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Top 7 HNI Investing Trends to Watch for in 2022","seo_keywords":"Top 7 HNI Investing Trends to Watch for in 2022","seo_description":"For the past two years, uncertainty and its derivative, indecision, overshadowed the world of investments, not to mention the personal lives of the investors.

More than a decade later, in 2021, India accommodates the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world after the US and China. Indian economy, with a horde of more than 60,000 start-ups, is bound to attract many international investments to India. It will bring more capital flows, create more start-ups, trigger more funding, and ultimately lead to boundless wealth creation. Investors worldwide have smelled this lucrative investment opportunity and began to dig down deeper into the newfound gold mine of investment opportunities. Luckily, there are still many long-term investment opportunities in this segment for everyone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Only institutional investors like pension funds have invested in this asset class to a large extent. Those investments were mainly through more late-stage Private Equity (PE) funds and Venture Capital (VC) funds. Anyway, the investment landscape is changing rapidly. Today, angel investors, syndicates, and micro-VC funds play a significant role, especially in the early-stage investment pooling.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Here are a few of the reasons for the sudden surge in interest and activity in the Indian start-up ecosystem:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has evolved with the start-up industry. Through Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) regulations, SEBI makes it easier for accredited investors to invest in Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) recognized start-ups.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Leading brands such as Tata and Reliance, among others, have begun to invest in start-ups. Tata Digital&rsquo;s investment in start-ups like Cultfit, 1mg, and Big basket can be taken as an example.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) of tech start-ups such as Zomato, Paytm, Policybazaar, and Nykaa have boosted Indian primary market activity. Goldman Sachs estimates that within the next 3-4 years, more than 150 private companies could go public, making India the fifth-largest IPO market in the world in terms of market capitalization. When more tech companies lace up for IPO, Indian equity indices could significantly represent the new-age economy sectors like e-commerce, technology, internet, and media. In addition, India has more than 71 unicorns (companies valued above $1B), and many are still not listed in the stock market.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian private market witnesses increased secondary transactions in many companies about to launch their IPOs. These oversized lots of investment instruments available in the private market are generally used by wealth management firms to circulate among their Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individual (UHNI) clients and provide liquidity to the companies. These are vested Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) sold by employees or an angel investor in most cases.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">International companies have increased their Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity in India, mainly on solid tech companies. It can be seen as their intention to enter the booming Indian market or use it as a global competitive edge.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian start-up ecosystem gets an additional boost as some traditional PE funds have also begun to identify the investment potential of tech start-ups. Along with that, ESOPs and exits have created significant wealth for founders and employees. This money is reinvested in the start-up ecosystem as these founders and employees become either Limited Partners (LPs) in VC funds or invest directly in start-ups as angel investors.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Traditional businesses once shunned this asset class, but now they are increasing their capital allocation. They are looking for more diversification now and willing to take larger bets. Their rationale for investing in the start-up ecosystem is outsized returns uncorrelated with the stock market, the opportunity to share their business acumen to rather new start-ups, stay updated with the latest technological trends, and explore innovative start-up ideas.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Now, let us look into some of the significant benefits of investing in the Indian start-up ecosystem.</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. An Early Bird Investment Opportunity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing in a start-up during its initial stage of development will be more beneficial to the investor as it will yield more profit than a late investment in an established company. It also gives the investor a rare opportunity to make business decisions and advise ambitious entrepreneurs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Higher Risk and Higher Return</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Start-ups come with a greater chance to fail as they are companies at an early growth stage, but the story will be different if it grows and turns into a great company. Then it will offer many lucrative monetary benefits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every investor should be aware that investing always comes with a risk. Therefore, an investor should spend a reasonable amount of time and effort researching the start-ups they plan to invest in. It not only helps them to reap profit but also reduces investment risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. A Better Opportunity for Diversification</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Start-ups emerge in different business sectors. Therefore, it gives an excellent diversification opportunity for the investors as they can invest in a wide range of start-ups in various market sectors. Moreover, the downturns of overall stock markets are less likely to impact the start-ups, which safeguards the investors from financial losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. An Opportunity to Invest in Dreams and Ambitions</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Entrepreneurs are ambitious individuals who bring innovative business ideas to the market. They are willing to take risks and accept challenges. It has been estimated that there are around 582 million entrepreneurs globally. Of these, 58.5 million entrepreneurs are in India, and the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing in start-ups allows investors to offer opinions and insights from their own experiences to budding entrepreneurs. Apart from capital investment, the investors can provide support and help them pave their way into the market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It has been predicted that India will become the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy by 2030. Start-ups can play a more significant role in this booming economic growth as they possess the potential to find out, develop and monetize a scalable business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, India is a country with one of the largest start-up ecosystems in the world, and investing in them provides them with a chance to stand out in the market. Investing in start-ups benefits and gives profits to investors and helps to promote and create new opportunities for others. It also provides an opportunity for an investor to contribute to aspiring innovations and become a significant part of a nation&rsquo;s economic progress.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687935082/eulwo4gsi5je4lypbvhc.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Indian Start-up Ecosystem: A Booming Gold Mine of Investment Opportunities","seo_keywords":"Indian Start-up Ecosystem: A Booming Gold Mine of Investment Opportunities","seo_description":"The launch of Flipkart in 2008 flagged off India’s start-up marathon.

instantly evoke images of frenzied and probably irrational speculative activity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Extreme prices that seem at odds with a rational explanation have occurred repeatedly throughout history. Tulip Mania, The 1929 stock market crash, Dot.com bubble and Global financial crisis are among the few examples when valuations seemed to be disconnected entirely from the forecasted observed performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In December, I would like to present discussions on the series of self-fulfilling bubbles &ndash; speculative bubbles. This article is a modest attempt to understand how each bubble alleviates the pain of the previous bubble, supports and justifies the next one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It all always starts with the belief that the world has entered a new bright dawn of history which will liberate man from his life of want and struggle (Forbes, 2010). Despite the wide range of assets that have witnessed bouts of irrational exuberance (tulips, cryptos and equities, to name but a few), bubbles seem to follow a similar pattern. As Marx noted, history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687935578/qt3chs92snmymzroolrf.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 814px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A bubble exists when high prices seem to be generated more by traders&rsquo; interests than economic fundamentals. One thing interesting to observe is that a bubble is always defined ex-post. At some point, the bubble bursts, and the price adjusts downwards, sometimes very quickly. Interestingly, hindsight bias kicks in and tall claims made by investors/ traders that they knew it all along fall apart. But the question is why did they participate and lose money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the most remarkable examples is the tulips bubble or the tulip mania of the 1630s. The tulip first appeared in western Europe in the 16th century. First, the wealthy, and then the middle class, became quite avid about the tulip, and soon high prices were paid for the rare tulip bulbs. Tulip demand seemed to escalate each year, particularly in Holland and Germany. By the 1630s, tulip markets sprang up in numerous cities with the sole purpose of facilitating tulip trade. Gambling and speculation seem to be taking hold, and many fortunes were made and then lost. Amazing stories of what goods people were willing to trade for you tulips have been recorded. The amount of goods often seems like a great deal to sell for a single tulip. Was the tulip mania a speculative bubble?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In hindsight, most would agree that people acted irrationally. What were they thinking? We may never know for sure, but one popular explanation is that people bought tulips because others would pay even more. According to the&nbsp;<strong>greater fool theory,</strong>&nbsp;you buy an asset that you realise is hyped because you think a foolish person is willing to pay even more. Maybe you are unwise, but there is a &lsquo;greater fool&rsquo; somewhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, we should not assume irrationality too quickly. Is a tulip fan who attaches a high value to a tulip bulb any more unreasonable than an art collector paying millions of dollars for a painting? Oddly enough but the high values associated with tulip bulbs could have been rationally based on people&rsquo;s preferences during that period in history. The bubble burst possibly due to unexpected change in preferences &ndash; unlikely perhaps, but not impossible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is intriguing how people value assets in various markets, from tulips to stocks. Investors and academics alike strive to quantify asset values based on observable factors. Still, experience indicates that the human side has very real effects. Shiller argues that investing in a speculative asset is a social activity. Fashion, change in taste, change in risk attitude and what appears in hindsight to be simply irrational impacts the asset values</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After stock price increases, the investors are less risk-averse because prior gains cushion subsequent losses. In contrast, the investor is concerned about further losses after stock price decreases and risk aversion increases. The result is higher volatility in stock prices. Changes in attitudes towards risk can significantly affect asset valuation and price changes&mdash;investors&rsquo; risk aversion increases after stock prices fall, reinforcing the drop in prices. In addition to higher risk aversion that might have resulted from downward market adjustments, perceptions of elevated risk seem to be widespread in recent months.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear readers, think whether cryptos are behaving like tulips or are you the tulip fancier? Would your ex-ante rational expectations of the future appear to be ex-post faulty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>&ldquo;It is easy to say just be yourself, but you should always try to better yourself.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687935663/xppn27bdgk5z1pdetmvw.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Tulips, Technology and Traders","seo_keywords":"Tulips, Technology and Traders","seo_description":"Extreme prices that seem at odds with a rational explanation have occurred repeatedly throughout history.

One day, while he was passing through his village, he noticed a lot of camels on the roadside. One of the camels looked upset and seemed uncomfortable because of a big bulge on its neck. Abdul didn&rsquo;t know a melon was struck in its throat.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While Abdul was staring at the camel, the camel&rsquo;s owner came up and noticed the big bulge on his camel&rsquo;s neck. The owner wasted no time. He tied a piece of cloth around the camel&rsquo;s neck and struck it with a cane. The melon inside the camel&rsquo;s neck was broken by his strike and the camel seemed relieved eventually.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Adbul was astonished. He thought he learnt something great from this experience. Deep inside his heart, he believed that he just got a ticket to the millionaire&rsquo;s club. To make a practical usage of his newfound knowledge, Abdul went to the next village situated on a hill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There he announced to the villagers that he had found out a cure for goitre. He also demanded a few thousand rupees and a soft piece of cloth from those who want to get rid of their goitre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During those days, a treatment for goitre hadn&rsquo;t been discovered. So, the arrival of a man with a treatment for goitre excited the villagers. They gathered around him, and an old lady with goitre came forward. She handed over the money along with a soft piece of cloth and asked Abdul to cure her goitre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Abdul was overjoyed: he got his first patient. He accepted the money from the old woman and took the piece of cloth from her. Abdul wrapped the soft cloth around her neck. Then, he took a cane and struck it hard on the old woman&rsquo;s neck. Woman was too old to bear such a smack. She fell down and died on the spot.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The mob turned angry and began to beat Abdul. The villagers, done with their hitting and beating, gave out an uncommon punishment to Abdul for killing an old woman in their village. They asked Abdul to dig a grave for her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As this village was situated on a hill, digging a grave was a mammoth task. Abdul took two days to dig the grave and to bury the old woman.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Abdul didn&rsquo;t learn anything from this painful experience. He set out for another village. Again, he announced a cure for goitre to the villagers. The news spread like wildfire and villagers gathered around him. This time an old man with goitre stepped forward with the money and a soft cloth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Abdul wrapped the cloth around the old man&rsquo;s neck and got ready to strike it with a cane. Suddenly, a second thought struck his head. Abdul stepped back and looked around.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cure this old man but only on one condition,&rdquo; shouted Abdul.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the condition?&rdquo; the villagers asked Abdul.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;You promise me that you&rsquo;ll not ask me to dig his grave,&rdquo; replied Abdul.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is how half-cooked knowledge works. This is how half-cooked knowledge risks yours as well as others&rsquo; lives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Our Half-Cooked Knowledge Of Finance</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India accommodates roughly 20% of the world population. The Indian population has a literacy rate of 74% but only nearly 25% possess financial literacy. These statistics have been revealed by a recent survey conducted by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and World Bank. However, the higher financial illiteracy rates prevail among almost every country in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Half cooked knowledge in any area of knowledge is dangerous, particularly, in finance. Most people think they can gain financial knowledge by experience, observation or by simply copying others. For this reason, they venture into any business either because it is popular, or they have seen it generating higher returns for someone else. They forget the fact that venturing into unknown territories, particularly without careful planning and study, is usually dangerous.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Solution</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century began with an Information Technology explosion. Today, we are living through an Information Age surrounded by endless information and knowledge to digest and utilize for our personal, financial, and professional needs. But still, we fail to make wise financial decisions. Why?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Again, a narrative to make the concept clear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One day, Rahul requested his friend, Vysakh, to invest in his flourishing computer software and hardware development business. For a wise opinion, Vysakh ringed his father who was enjoying his retired life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Vysakh&rsquo;s father listened patiently to his son&rsquo;s future business plans. After listening, he asked Vysakh a simple question: &ldquo;Vysakh, do you know how to develop a computer software and to fix its hardware problems?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Vysakh answered &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;Son, then never invest in that business,&rdquo; advised Vysakh&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Vysakh&rsquo;s father, in truth, gave out a billion-dollar advice to his son. Even billionaire investors like Warren Buffet never invest in a business they cannot understand. In today&rsquo;s world flooding with information and knowledge, comprehension and meticulous application of knowledge always takes a backseat. It is similar to possessing half-cooked knowledge which is more dangerous than ignorance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some of the areas of finance such as lending, banking, investing, even the concept of money itself have been around, in one form or another, since the dawn of civilization. But finance emerged as a separate field of theory and practice diverging from the field of economics in the mid-20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. That means, Finance is a new field of knowledge for us.

If this has also been accompanied by late nights, erratic meal times, etc., I am sure you are with me in this realization that it would be nice to shed a few kgs/pounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But let&rsquo;s be honest, if the choice is between a piece of jalebi/cake for dessert or pushing the plate away, that is, between current gratification and deferred gratification, many of us will opt for the former. After all, nobody likes to give up what is pleasant. Though we all know what the right choice is, sometimes we can&rsquo;t follow through.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Before you all confuse this piece with being a health advisory, I must clarify that it is just an attempt to highlight not only the imperfections of markets but also the areas where self-evaluation may provide ideas for improvement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We all have gotten pretty good at combing the market for opportunities but less skilful at examining ourselves for potential cognitive flaws. People realize that they sometimes need self-imposed disciplines and rules. They also recognize that controlling their environment can be helpful.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Continuing our weight loss analogy, one can see that diet is a set of rules. For example, one diet might specify that one is not supposed to eat more than a certain number of calories per day or is not allowed any dessert. Environmental control is essential if you are on a no dessert diet. It is probably not wise to accompany your friends to a dessert restaurant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The choice between current and deferred gratification is what influences retirement planning decisions. Saving for retirement is a decades-long endeavour with both expected and unexpected factors affecting confidence and preparedness. Much of the conversation focuses on amassing a nest egg, it&rsquo;s also important to look at what other factors play in planning for retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">How workers decide to save, manage their retirement investments, and draw down their assets in retirement is important. It is interesting to see how workers and retirees deviate from the rational, well-informed aspects that underpin economic and financial theory. Often expectations are misaligned with current income levels. An individual believes in having champagne Budgets on Little Savings&mdash;indicating disconnect between savings and reality, belief that the retirement income will cover basic living expenses and provide a budget for at least some travel and leisure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687935910/owsngzqdadlgzrbuo9pu.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 483px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Surveys and studies find that most people fear that they will not have enough income, will not have enough money for medical expenses and may not be able to live independently for the entirety of their retirement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another regret is not keeping up with the inflation, which today&rsquo;s retirees will struggle with current yields in debt products.&nbsp; Ideally, the financial decisions made by investors should be based on underlying fundamentals. However, in reality, extraneous non-financial factors influence it, for instance, the presentation of choice menus, which can influence decisions across many domains. It is popularly referred as &ldquo;menu effects.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Mostly, individuals allocate their assets evenly across the alternatives provided, regardless of the underlying intrinsic nature of each option. This phenomenon is referred to as &lsquo;naive diversification&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The evidence suggests that many people save too little, others make poor investment decisions, and others spend their accumulated assets too quickly in retirement. The &lsquo;behavioural&rsquo; reasons for such tendencies include overconfidence, limited self-control, overvaluation of the present at the expense of the future, framing and loss aversion biases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687935944/apvqnbkn6tdcgku2zeel.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 680px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The literature suggests that the plan design should be automatic for the many individuals unwilling to exercise complete control over their retirement savings choices.

Moreover, in the Digital Age of high-speed internet connectivity and advanced smartphone technology, investing in international markets is not a difficult endeavour.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article will explore 4 simple ways to invest in international stocks. Before that, let&rsquo;s look into the reasons why Indians want to invest in International stocks in the first place.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Why Do Indians Love International Stocks?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are more than 5,500 listed companies in the Indian equity market. There are many Indian companies that can give tight competition to International companies. International companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Tesla hold multi-billion-dollar cash, highly qualified professionals, and bring big innovations in their respective sectors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, are these heavy capital resources and innovations being the sole factors that attract Indian investors towards international stocks? The answer is a straightforward &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here are the major reasons why many Indians love to invest in stocks trading in the US or other foreign stock exchanges.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Darlings of this generation</strong>: The international companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla are darlings of this generation and people love to invest in their favourite companies.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Diversification effort</strong>: Investing in international markets and stocks helps diversification in a portfolio. Investments in a foreign stock or market can mitigate the risk of the downturn in the Indian equity market owing to some regional economic or political reasons. Apart from diversification, investing in foreign stocks would provide greater stability in a portfolio.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A limitless investing opportunity:&nbsp;</strong>International markets are a boundless investment arena with better profitable investment opportunities.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Now, let&rsquo;s look at the 4 simple ways to invest in foreign stocks.</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1) Through a trading account with an Indian stock broking firm that collaborates with other international stock broking firms.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many full-service Indian stockbroking companies like ICICI Direct, Reliance Money, HDFC Securities, Axis Securities, and Kotak Securities collaborate with international stockbroking firms like Interactive Brokers LLC. You can easily open your overseas trading account with the international stockbroking partner of your Indian stockbroker and invest in foreign stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) You can directly open a trading account with an international stock broker</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A few international stockbroking companies like Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab International Account allow Indian citizens to directly open a trading account and to trade or invest in international stocks and funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Interactive Brokers LLC has an office in India. You can make a visit, and after getting all your queries answered, directly open your overseas trading account from the comfort of an office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3) Through financial mobile applications</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many start-up investment firms like Grow, Vested Finance, and Webull have launched financial mobile applications that allow Indians and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to invest in foreign stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4) Indirect international investments through Indian Mutual Funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are a number of Mutual Funds and ETFs that invest in international equity markets. These funds are not only the easiest way to invest in foreign stocks but also the cheaper way to do it. You don&rsquo;t need an overseas trading account to invest through these funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity, Motilal Oswal NASDAQ 100 ETF, and Nippon India US Equity Opportunities Fund are some of the popular mutual funds and ETFs that trade in global equities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some of the Indian stockbrokers like Zerodha are planning to set up facilities for their clients to directly invest in US and other international markets with no minimum investment. These yet-to-be launched facilities show the Indian stockbrokers&rsquo; efforts to cater to the rising enthusiasm of the Indian retail investors on international investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Crucial Factors To Consider Before Taking A Plunge Into International Investments</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">International investments don&rsquo;t come without any flaws or drawbacks. Here are a few crucial factors to consider before you invest in foreign stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1) Higher Brokerage</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When it comes to international investments, you will be transacting in foreign currencies. For instance, if you are investing in the US financial market, you have to pay the brokerages and taxes in the US dollar. Therefore, the brokerage, taxes and account maintenance fee may be a little higher compared to the brokerage, taxes and the maintenance fee of domestic trading accounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) Currency Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">You should take into consideration the currency risk associated with international investments. Let&rsquo;s make the idea clear with the help of an example.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When you bought a stock in the US stock market at the current currency exchange rate of $1= ₹74. However, when you sell the stock next year, the Indian currency may get stronger, and the currency exchange rate becomes $1 = ₹69.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If that is the case, you have to bear the loss of the change in the currency rate along with the profit or loss of the stock&rsquo;s sale.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3) There is a limit for overseas investments by an Individual resident Indian</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notification in the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) points out a limit for an individual resident Indian for overseas investments. The limit is set at $250,000 per year. With the current exchange rate ($1= ₹74), this amount turns out to be roughly 19 million Indian rupees. Anyway, if you have four family members, you can invest 4 x 19 million Indian rupees. That constitutes around 76 million Indian Rupees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4) The macroeconomic trends in international markets.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Besides the above-mentioned factors, you also need to keep in mind the unpredictable macroeconomic trends in international markets like the regional government policies along with political and economic trends that may affect the prices of foreign stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Final Words</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stock market investments are always considered risky, but they can generate higher return in the long run than traditional fixed return generating investments. To reduce the investment risk, it&rsquo;s very important to diversify your portfolio among various stocks in different sectors rather than investing in just one stock or sector.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investing in foreign stocks, without doubt, can generate higher returns and helps to diversify your portfolio. But you should also keep in mind that the Indian economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and most of the international markets are a little stagnant. It is always better to invest in an economy where growth takes place.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687937168/jyckicrqpl52mad2oxtp.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"What Are Different Ways To Invest In International Equities?","seo_keywords":"What Are Different Ways To Invest In International Equities?","seo_description":"Have you ever thought of investing in globally leading innovative companies such as Apple, Google (Alphabet), Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, and Tesla?

And as an aware investor, you must be mindful of the ABC of the ESG!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. The concept of ESG has been around for a long time, with its origins going back as far as 2005. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued an ESG proposal submitted to the CEOs of the world&rsquo;s leading financial institutions. Annan invited the CEOs to join an initiative, later known as Principles for Responsible Investment, to tighten the relationship between investors and the ESG issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, over these years, ESG has gradually evolved as a tool for the&nbsp;management&nbsp;to deliver outstanding returns to all stakeholders of a business. Companies all over the globe have been sensitized about the various aspects of ESG. Stock exchanges&nbsp;across the world seek to report on ESG principles. At the same time, ESG compliance opens up doors for global funding for businesses across the globe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For a&nbsp;CEO, who cares about the long-term sustainability of the business, ESG is an opportunity to create value, drive profitability, and raise capital. ESG bonds have already made a mark in India, with Indian companies raising over $5 billion in the calendar year 2021 so far.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687937284/cvt5zmralfmhldkvjpql.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 675px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ESG assets are set to reach over $50 trillion by 2025. According to&nbsp;Bloomberg, that&rsquo;s a third of total global assets under management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Within the corporate environment, institutions are prioritizing their emphasis on ESG, moving beyond traditional corporate responsibility. Large financial institutions increasingly see ESG as corporate social responsibility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The&nbsp;S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&nbsp;analyzed 26 ESG exchange-traded funds and mutual funds with more than $250 million in assets under management. It found that from March 5, 2020, the month that the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to March 5, 2021, 19 of those funds performed better than the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;Those outperformers rose between 27.3% and 55% over that period. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 increased just 27.1%. An ethical investment portfolio can actually protect you from risk while allowing you to make a positive impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The pandemic highlighted social and global inequality. It also pushed millions into poverty. The&nbsp;World Bank calculates&nbsp;that COVID-19 sent around 97 million people into poverty in 2020, and the negative impact continues to weigh. The pandemic has been such an existential crisis &ndash; such a stark reminder of the world&rsquo;s fragility &ndash; that it has driven the world to confront the global threat of climate change more forcefully and to consider how, like the pandemic, it will alter lives across the globe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">At the same time, the creation of sustainable index investments has enabled a massive acceleration of capital towards companies better prepared to address ESG factors. Indeed, from January through November 2020, investors in mutual funds and ETFs invested $288 billion globally in sustainable assets, a&nbsp;96% increase over the whole of 2019.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Initially, ESG investments had a reputation for generating limited returns. But, today, the data suggests that there is an intrinsic relationship between a company&rsquo;s ESG performance and long-term financial health. Traditional funds showed higher potential for loss during&nbsp;turbulent&nbsp;market years like 2008, 2009, 2015, and 2018, while sustainable funds posted strong performance.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to Bank of America, ESG investing could rise by $15 trillion to $20 trillion over the next decade because of changing demographics. As millennials, Gen-Z, and the generations to follow step into investor shoes, they are increasingly likely to select their portfolios based on companies that measure up to ESG metrics. The act of picking sustainable funds is reasonably intuitive due to&nbsp;respective companies being categorized by data providers. But despite this, it can be challenging to find a firm that fully subscribes to the ESG approach throughout.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some advisers suggest that it&rsquo;s worth engaging with fund groups to see how companies deal with ESG issues in a bid to see whether they conform to a clear policy or not.&nbsp;Another positive comes from the fact that sustainable investing is growing in popularity today.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With significant increases in social and environmental awareness worldwide, shares from ESG companies, in particular, look set to ride this wave of interest and grow exponentially as a result. If this occurs, then investors will benefit from gaining some sizeable profits from green companies along the way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Of course, investing in ESG shares comes with a few downsides, too. By far, the most significant drawback comes from the lack of diversity offered by ESG shares. Sadly, most companies that fit the criteria focus exclusively on large-cap stocks, limiting the prospect of diversification among investor portfolios. Thus, investors may find themselves starved of exposure to small-cap, mid-cap and non-US based companies.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another con is that some ESG mutual funds and ETFs and DIY investors develop strategies that entirely exclude specific industries, like tobacco and oil. While avoiding these industries is undoubtedly a good thing as far as the environmentally and socially conscious among us would agree, it only serves to enhance the risk of investors placing all their focus on very few industries &ndash; such as hydropower or electronic vehicles &ndash; which runs the risk of further diversification issues.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For example, a heavily populated portfolio by wind-based energy suppliers is great in terms of adhering to sustainable investments. Still, investors could find themselves hamstrung if a windfarm is forced to close down or sanctions lower the global usage of wind power.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687937311/tdduinr4wzdowmq0emc8.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 715px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So dear investors, it&rsquo;s important to remember that socially responsible investing is a highly subjective matter, and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that companies recognized as sustainable match your beliefs or investment goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With this in mind, it&rsquo;s essential to conduct your research before buying shares or funds. Look for companies that match your ambitions and beliefs, and the act of investing in them will be its reward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the rising sensitivity towards the environment and social issues, it would be prudent to grab a bite in the ESG pie in your investment portfolios. ESG investing is likely to have a robust future and are expected to beat the index returns in the near term.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687937390/zcjibyvp4ihw78e3t5om.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Are you an ESG Investor?","seo_keywords":"Are you an ESG Investor?","seo_description":"ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance.

But one of the most important one being about savings, financial planning, and investments. It was the financial lifestyle of the ones who made wise and calculated financial decisions that was left unscathed during this tough phase of the global economic meltdown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is worth noting that during this trying period, we have witnessed investors move their assets to safe havens. We have seen the crumbling down of traditional business models and the rise of New Age investments such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&lsquo;An investment in gold will save you in difficult times.&rsquo; It has been a powerful age-old wisdom for Indians. According to the World Gold Council&rsquo;s (WGC) estimate, approximately 25,000 tonnes of gold has been accumulated by the Indians households; that is, roughly 12.65% of nearly 2 lakh tonnes of the yellow metal mined throughout human history!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Traditionally, investments in gold have generated good returns. It has been an intelligent investment move to hedge the volatility of the stock market with gold. But with the advent of cryptocurrency that has generated even better returns than gold, the yellow metal&rsquo;s lustre has been diminishing. Thus, Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, is the new hot cake just taken out of the oven.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Factors Favouring Gold</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The precious yellow metal is highly valuable and limited in supply regardless of the demand. It is a high in demand raw material for consumer goods such as jewellery and a stable investment vehicle.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While a company can issue new shares, and a central bank can print fiat currency, gold can&rsquo;t be manufactured to meet the demand. It must be mined and processed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Above everything else, central banks issue fiat currency on the gold standard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Factors Favouring Cryptocurrency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency run on Blockchain technology, shares some properties with gold. Since Bitcoin is not linked with other traditional assets such as stocks or stock market, many have termed Bitcoin as &lsquo;digital gold&rsquo; of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As a storage of value, Bitcoin has marked a great improvement over gold and the post-pandemic world has taken it into consideration and began to track cryptocurrencies in real-time. Last few months have witnessed Bitcoin&rsquo;s value increase multifold and it is likely to continue appreciating in monetary terms over the coming years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In fact, gold underperformed Bitcoin for the last decade. Bitcoin has generated an annual return of around 230% in the last 10 years while gold could provide an average return of 12-14% to the investors. It has been estimated that by 2030 Bitcoin&rsquo;s market capitalization will surpass gold&rsquo;s. Bitcoin crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization mark in February 2020.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Millennials and the Generation Z (Gen Z) do most of their financial transactions virtually and they are not too much attached to the tangibility of the assets they hold. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have given them access to a digital asset that can be, in the long run, more rewarding than Gold.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Gold And Cryptocurrency &ndash; A Comparison</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Both Bitcoin and gold are rare in terms of supply but in the terms of transparency, legality, and safety, gold outsmarts cryptocurrency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gold and Bitcoin are liquid assets but both diverge when it comes to volatility. Bitcoin is much more volatile than gold. The precious yellow metal also holds a long history of being a less volatile investment vehicle than a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The world of cryptocurrency is surrounded by speculations, rumours, and abrupt market crashes. The major number of the crypto investors belong to the rich class who possess higher technological knowledge. But for gold, it is not the case. Anyone belongs to any economic class and any level of technological knowledge has access to the traditional gold market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It has been anticipated for years that gold&rsquo;s supply will end one day. But in reality, its supply has eventually increased, though not in accordance with the demand. Still today, there exists many unexplored gold mines in various parts of the world, and we are not sure of how much gold is still waiting to be explored.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The supply of Bitcoin is entirely different. Roughly 97% of Bitcoins has been mined till date, that is, around 19 million of the limits of 21 million.&nbsp; It has been estimated that the last bitcoin will be mined by 2140.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Food For An Investment Thought</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The primary intention of this article is to bring out the merits and demerits of both gold and Bitcoin. By now, you are aware of the roles gold and Bitcoin play in today&rsquo;s financial world. Now it is the time to take a little thought on how to take these assets into consideration as investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The governments and regulatory bodies all over the globe are still mulling over regulating the cryptocurrency markets. Hence, till a consensus has been reached, it should be very important not to allow greed or the lure of higher returns drive your investment decisions. The returns of the investments and the safety of the capital depends on the sole discretion of an investor where he or she wants to invest and how he or she wants to do it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to financial experts, both assets are often seen either as a diversification tool in a portfolio or as a hedge against inflation. It is always advisable to have a balanced portfolio. Even when it comes to cryptocurrency investment, keeping a balanced investment approach is a must.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The expert suggestion is that though investments in Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t come with any limits, it would be wise not to put all your savings, or emergency fund in it. Some experts suggest that the investments in cryptocurrency should not exceed more than 5 percent of your portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you have seen, gold and Bitcoin have different roles to play as an asset. So, an investor must, first of all, assess his or her risk appetite and then strategically diversify the investment portfolio. It is also advisable to seek assistance from financial advisors before making such investment decisions. An investor should learn the basics of investing and do their own unbiased research before taking a plunge into cryptocurrency investing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687937771/irwlyg4v2d5p3k85yff3.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Bitcoin vs Gold – Analysis","seo_keywords":"Bitcoin vs Gold – Analysis","seo_description":"The Corona pandemic has taught us many lessons that touched almost every aspect of our lives.

The Nobel Prize winning theory defends a diversified, or an &lsquo;optimal&rsquo; portfolio. That is, a portfolio that allocates assets to maximize return by taking up a quantifiable amount of risk. In other words, a quantitative risk assessment method could be implemented along with diversification and calculated asset allocation to bring down investment risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Nobel Prize Portfolio in a Nutshell&nbsp;</b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Modern Portfolio Theory, proposed by Markowitz initially as a research paper to build a portfolio of assets to deliver maximum returns with a stipulated level of risk, was first published by the Journal of Finance in 1952. A portfolio built on Modern Portfolio Theory is also known as the Nobel Prize Portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Prior to Harry Markowitz&rsquo;s Modern Portfolio Theory, the returns from investing were largely calculated in terms of the performance of an individual investment. Markowitz demonstrated that the collective performance of the assets in a portfolio is more significant in generating returns than the performance of a particular asset or stock.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A portfolio with diversified investment classes and financial instruments has lower correlation to each other. That means, their performance and returns vary in accordance with different stock market cycles and macroeconomic conditions. This variety in investment classes and securities reduces the volatility of a portfolio and guards it against unexpected financial market shocks.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The quantitative risk analysis method of a Nobel Prize Portfolio uses the past data on investment risk and returns along with the expected investment returns in future. It also takes into consideration the investor preferences to build an optimised portfolio of assets that delivers the higher returns at the lowest possible risk.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Shortcomings of a Nobel Prize Portfolio</b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The major shortcoming of a Nobel Prize Portfolio is the complexity associated with its mathematical model. The quantitative risk analysis method of MPT is based on the evaluation of historical investment returns and volatility. That means, the portfolio can be highly vulnerable to unknown variables in the future or the ones investors fail to consider during the time of creating the equation. This risk analysis method based on projected values and predictive mathematical calculations is far from reality and fails to deal with the risks in the real investment world. In other words, the investing process may appear orderly using the mathematical risk assessment model of MPT; yet, in reality, it makes a probabilistic risk assessment, not a structural one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the late 1970s, a researcher named Sanjay Basu demonstrated&nbsp;something contrary to the Modern Portfolio Theory: low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) stocks outperform high P/E stocks. In the early 1980s, Rolf Banz, another finance scholar, demonstrated&nbsp;that small capitalization (small cap) stocks outperformed large capitalization (large cap) stocks. His theory is popularly known as Small Firm Effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is another reason &ndash; apart from abiding by the Securities and Exchange Bureau of India (SEBI) guidelines &ndash; most investment firms never fail to note &lsquo;past performance does not necessarily predict future results&rsquo; in the documentation of their investment products.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">There is a greater irony: The father of Nobel prize winning Modern Portfolio Theory never trusted his brainchild when building his portfolio. Jason Zweig, a well-known financial journalist, mentioned this in his bestselling book Your Money and Your Brains. Here is the excerpt from the book &ndash; an expert in linear programming, he [Harry Markowitz] knows that &ldquo;I should have computed the historical co-variances of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier. Instead, I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up, and I wasn&rsquo;t in it &mdash; or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So, I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Why did Harry Markowitz choose an equal weightage asset allocation in his portfolio? Why did he avoid his Nobel Prize winning investment theory?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The answer is quite simple: He chose simplicity over complexity.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Simplicity Is the Key</b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to Albert Einstein, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t explain it simply, you don&rsquo;t understand it well enough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Einstein is right both in scientific and investment terms. In the world of finance, simple investment theories and practices always have an upper hand over sophisticated strategies and theories. A simple investment strategy is the best strategy an investor can ever adopt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nevertheless, the human mind always hunts for complexity and sophistication as we believe that only through sophisticated investment strategies, we can beat the market. Investors, especially the ones with larger capital allocation, fall prey to his terrible investment mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even market pundits are not saved from this trap. The market genius who talks nonstop about the future of the stock market or particular securities makes us believe that he or she knows everything about the financial markets and the investment world. But in reality, they are simple humans with sophisticated investment strategies. Most of them don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know and their job demands giving out careless opinions and comments on both finance and non-finance matters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Just take a few seconds to think, how many of these experts predicted the CoVID spread and subsequent financial market downturns all over the globe? How many of them successfully predicted the bullish market trends in the financial markets all over the world soon after the turmoil?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The purpose of this article is not to question Harry Markowitz&rsquo;s Nobel Prize Portfolio or to blame market pundits. Here, the objective is to shed some light on no matter the level of our expertise, we fail miserably to predict the unknown future. As investors, we may have solutions to known investment risks, but when unknown risks are concerned, we render clueless. Every investment theory, including MPT, may guard us against known risks but, unfortunately, not against unknown risks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>Bottom Line</b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Diversification and calculated capital allocation are the best hedges against unknown risks. A solid hedge against complexity is always simplicity. Never confuse yourself with the sophisticated investment strategies proposed by your financial planner or portfolio manager. Always remember that complexity damages your hard-earned capital. Simplify your investment strategies and invest only in the stocks of the businesses that are simple to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research Team</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687938376/omlpzvoxoikvo9uz2tjz.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How To Beat a Nobel Prize Portfolio?","seo_keywords":"How To Beat a Nobel Prize Portfolio?","seo_description":"In 1990, Markowitz was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his Modern Portfolio Theory.

In other words, a quantitative risk assessment method could be implemented along with diversification and calculated asset allocation to bring down investment risk.","seo_blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687938374/hcjyw9ylszrher1l3lpv.webp","created_at":"Jun 28, 2023"},{"blog_id":"137","title":"5 Charts – Interesting Stories on Markets and Investing (Research)","slug":"5-charts-interesting-stories-on-markets-and-investing-research-3","category":"General","published_by":"Alpha Research","published_date":"1634632437","published_date_view":"Oct 19, 2021","discription":"<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>1) Balance sheet analysis of Indian companies:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687941452/jaevvpouilysjdaxxs1m.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px;

In such a long period even considering 6%-7% product as an option should be considered foolish. Equity is best asset class for long term where investor can expect 12%-14% CAGR.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Arena 2 &ndash; Insurance</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Traditional plan are not a good choice.

Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency in the world, took birth in 2008 soon after the financial market fiasco. The credit partially goes to the distrust of the current centralised financial systems all over the world.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The idea of Satoshi Nakamoto &ndash; the pseudonym of Bitcoin&rsquo;s inventor &mdash; was to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer monetary system that would eliminate the inefficiencies of the current centralized global financial systems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrencies are built on Blockchain technology with the idea of a decentralized online cash system that allows financial transactions without a verification from a third-party like a central bank. It is a database that is shared across a global network of computers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is very difficult to tamper or merely edit a record once it has been added to the chain. The blockchain network conducts constant verification to ensure the authenticity of all the copies of the database.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Apart from supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain technology can also be efficiently used in the fields of banking, supply chain, healthcare, voting, and keeping property records.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Cryptocurrency, An Asset Class?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, cryptocurrencies have turned into a topic for heated discussion all over the world and are considered by some as the &lsquo;currency of the future&rsquo;. As days pass by, more and more people take cryptocurrencies as a tool for investment rather than a medium of exchange.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Adoption of cryptocurrency is rising fast in India. The businesses involved in the cryptocurrency sphere not only take cryptocurrencies as an asset class but also try to convince the financial regulators of the country against banning them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Liquidity, stability, value, and a low transaction cost are the four major factors that determine a good asset class. The aim of this article is to point out whether cryptocurrencies possess all these four factors to consider them as a good asset class. The decision to take a plunge in the world of cryptocurrency investing or trading rests solely at the discretion of the reader.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Deflationary Asset</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now let&rsquo;s take up the first factor: Liquidity. Most of the cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin come with a limit in production. For Bitcoin, it is 21 million. Some cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t have a market cap but hold limits on their annual production. For instance, as of now, nearly 19 million Bitcoins have been generated, that means, 83 percent of the limit of Bitcoin production has been reached. Today, the Bitcoin market capitalisation has hit roughly $866 billion (approximately ₹64,35,270 crores).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrency enthusiasts aren&rsquo;t concerned about the deflationary nature of cryptocurrency supply. As far as Bitcoin is concerned, the infinite divisibility feature stands as an advantage. As Bitcoin gets more valuable in future, it can be transacted in smaller units named Satoshis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fiat currencies, in contrast, can be printed and distributed by the central banks of respective countries. But if this additional creation of the paper currency doesn&rsquo;t sync with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of the respective country, it may lead to a surge in inflation and related economic issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Highly Volatile Cryptocurrency Market</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrency market, as everyone knows, is highly volatile and notorious for reckless speculative activities. Even the expert cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors find it hard to deal with the unpredictable volatility of these digital financial instruments. Abrupt market crashes resulting from sudden selloff by &lsquo;whale&rsquo; investors or technical glitches at cryptocurrency exchanges have troubled the unregulated cryptocurrency markets since the day of their inception. Therefore, a higher market risk, a by-product of cryptocurrencies, stands against the stability factor required for a good asset class.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Cryptocurrency &ndash; a liquid, or illiquid asset?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset can be traded or converted into cash without affecting its market price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrencies, with no doubt, have generated lucrative returns for early investors. But along with higher volatility in prices, cryptocurrencies also suffer from abrupt illiquidity. An unstable market and a lower number of cryptocurrency users are among the few factors that contribute towards the illiquidity of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The introduction of Satoshis in Bitcoin has greatly improved its liquidity, but it is not the case with other cryptocurrencies &ndash; they remain vulnerable to abrupt drying up of liquidity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrencies have a long way to go. These New Age financial instruments, though moving ahead in an unpredictable trajectory, are gaining acceptance worldwide. The cryptocurrency-friendly approach of countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia can be taken in a positive note that helps to reduce the liquidity risk of cryptocurrencies in future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Higher Transaction Costs</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum come with higher transaction costs in the form of exchange fees, network fees, and wallet fees. The higher amount of electric and computational power required to generate cryptocurrencies also adds to the cost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This higher transaction costs works against cryptocurrencies when it comes to taking them as a good asset class. It also keeps traditional investors away from considering cryptocurrencies as an investment avenue or using them as a medium of exchange.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Doubtful Storage of Value</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, the global cryptocurrency market crossed $1.7 trillion capitalization. However, many still are sceptical about the ability of a cryptocurrency to act as a stable storage of value. Crediting its limited supply, some term it as &lsquo;digital gold&rsquo; while others doubt it as &lsquo;digital Tulipmania &lsquo;. According to popular author and risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the true value of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin is zero.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All these mixed responses are mainly because of the high volatility and unpredictability associated with it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Sunnier Future</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many institutional investors and Fortune 500 companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy are adopting various cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin as a hedge against their speculations of higher inflation in future and &lsquo;black swan&rsquo; events like the Corona pandemic. Globally, Tesla is among the one of the first companies that have already converted a great part, or their entire balance sheet cash into cryptocurrency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Amid abrupt market crashes and notoriety associated with cryptocurrencies, financial regulators in some countries have shown a willingness to consider cryptocurrencies as an asset class. They also allow asset management firms to launch financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and crypto-backed bonds that give access to investors in a regulated environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, the proposed cryptocurrency law of the Finance Ministry is about to take a more calibrated approach towards cryptocurrencies. Let&rsquo;s hope all these optimistic developments can lead to the birth of the foundation of a stable financial asset class.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942105/t5jjg8t39onx16cviii8.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Can Cryptocurrency be considered as an Asset Class?","seo_keywords":"Can Cryptocurrency be considered as an Asset Class?","seo_description":"The global financial crisis of 2008 had made several investors and finance pundits raise their eyebrows regarding the shortfalls of the current global centralized financial system.

However, I have my reasons to be wary of using this indicator. This ratio has the market cap in the numerator, a stock concept (at a particular time) and GDP in the denominator, a flow concept (over some time). Having said that, is there any inference we can draw from this indicator?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To begin with, let&rsquo;s look at the graph of the world market cap to GDP. Sourced from the world bank, it spans 1976 till 2020. It indicates that the two peaks when the Market Cap / GDP ratio crossed the 100% mark represent the two massive peaks of 1999 (Dotcom bubble) and 2007(global financial crisis). In 2017 market once again touched the 100 mark but corrected quickly. However, since 2020, amidst the worldwide pandemic devastation, the markets have been above the 100 mark.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942253/moepwaro5sxoml1s4k1x.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 553px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Source: World Bank data</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Looking at the same numbers for India exhibits an interesting pattern. The peak was observed in 2007. Interestingly, 2020 saw India&rsquo;s market cap / GDP ratio crossing the 100% mark after a gap of almost ten years amid the pandemic. Roaring stocks in the struggling economy brings to the forefront a disturbing disconnect between the stock market and real economic growth. So, if the past is any prologue and we are to learn anything from history, then this is something that the world markets need to be cautious about, but not be scared.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942281/vpsm2gm8kvqhlzi1ovuu.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 656px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to the original Buffet Indicator, the Stock Market is Significantly Overvalued. However, In India, particularly demonetisation, Goods and service tax (GST) has brought more and more Indian businesses into the mainstream, which is gradually reflected in the market cap / GDP ratio. To that extent, there may not be room to worry. We all have been living with the belief that economic growth and the stock market are correlated. A higher economic growth/ recovery is reflected in higher stock market returns. In the present situation, however, this relationship seems to be failing. So how can one make sense of the long-term relationship (or the lack of one!!) which runs counter to our received wisdom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Examining the factors of this tremendous increase, following pointers are to be kept in mind.&nbsp; The recent IPO glut (roughly A lakh crore of raised money) has added to the market cap without disturbing the GDP.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another vital factor is that the stock market is (or at least attempts to be) forward-looking while GDP is backwards looking. It implies that the higher prices we are witnessing today anticipate higher economic growth (GDP).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors&rsquo; expectations that &lsquo;the GDP is already at its bottom and what worse can happen further&rsquo; is driving these returns. On the other hand, GDP indicates what has happened in the future, more recent quarter &ndash; the economy&rsquo;s actual performance. As the investor&rsquo;s greed and fear emotions dominate the market- it has decoupled from the fundamentals. Stock returns somewhat move with economic growth but have a life of their own driven by greed, fear, optimism, and emotions. And because these emotions tend to fluctuate more than the economy does, so do stock returns &mdash; this is a significant reason why stocks are more volatile than economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942306/jqobksgaudxos7jbbh7u.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 586px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Considering India, positioned as one of the fastest-growing economies, the investor&rsquo;s community&rsquo;s exuberance may not be totally unfounded. In their attempts to moderate the impact of covid 19 pandemic, liquidity being pumped into the economies globally by the to fight the recession and to moderate the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Foreign capital is finding its way to the Indian markets, contributing to high stock index values.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942331/cbhsod4xpuptudwh9ynr.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 444px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another possible factor contributing to the dismantling of the relationships in the last few years is the economic imbalances. Few companies/ sectors like Information technology and pharmaceuticals are fueling the stock market. Typically, the ones who were not much affected, or were quick to recover and adapt in these unprecedented times. For example, companies with economies of scale-like Reliance and Hindustan Unilever or an IT company like TCS or Infosys, are not overly impacted by physical supply chains. Hence, these stocks are gaining value much faster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is rightly said that FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix and Google) are not the economy; they represent just a fraction of the total economy. At times, the stock index could be heavily weighted towards the companies with the futures that everyone is most excited about rather than the ones whose presents have the most significant impact on the current economy. The market is not the economy. Its job is to tabulate investors&rsquo; consensus views about the future of listed companies, with no attention paid to the private businesses, MSMEs, government and other vital parts of the economy. In sum, the stock market&rsquo;s buoyancy is echoing the revival in the organised sector.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, GDP reflects the pain in the informal sector, where the recovery is painstakingly slow. &nbsp;The impact of Covid 19 has been more severe on the informal sector. One can still see the flashes of the sight when thousands of migrant labourers were forced to travel on foot.&nbsp; Specifically in India, though the contribution of agriculture and industries to GDP and their representation in the stock market performance is declining over the period, it is still the largest employer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another reason for the unexplained optimism in the market, despite the pessimistic GDP forecasts, is the strong household balance sheets, which is often a common outcome of the recessions in the past.&nbsp; This is partly due to the fewer spending and borrowing opportunities, greater control on expenditure, coupled with financial stimulus/ relief packages. Suppose you leave out the most vulnerable sections. In that case, most people are still employed and earning close to their pre-recession income but spending a lot less. Increasing number of Demat accounts corroborates this fact. With low bond yields, investors are left with little room to invest in assets other than equities. This triggers the fundamental demand-supply dynamics in the stock market and pushes the stock prices higher.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A poor GDP forecast adds fuel to the equity demand. Investors expect RBI to maintain an easy monetary policy stance.&nbsp; Nationwide vaccination drive, easing out of lockdown curbs, and signs of economic recovery in the future are possible reasons the market to celebrate. But this celebration is only for fundamentally strong companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This confounding dichotomy might not be surprising anymore if we look at the broader picture. The differential impact of lockdown on the organised and unorganised sector is the main reason for this seeming disconnect between the stock market performance and the real economy. Given this, the future will belong to resilient companies which are agile and efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I leave you all with hope. I hope that the Indian economy will return to robust growth in the near future, indicated by Moody&rsquo;s sovereign rating upgrade. I hope that the policymakers will find innovative ways to address the pain points in the informal sector. I hope that a rise in stock prices would bring about a wealth effect, which increases consumption. This increased consumer spending would give a fillip to economic growth. The increased use of technology would improve the data collection and analysis, gradually reducing the underreporting of revenues to save taxes, giving a more realistic picture of the GDP. And I hope this sharp rise in market capitalisation to GDP ratio is not temporary, but a new normal for the Indian Economy!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687942464/gspj3cvrzrttdpfucuwt.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Enigmatic Relationship of Stock Market & GDP","seo_keywords":"The Enigmatic Relationship of Stock Market & GDP","seo_description":"Warren Buffett states the ratio of market capitalization (market cap) to GDP as “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” Undoubtedly, investing community uses it worldwide to judge whether the market is over/underpriced.

The exponential technological advancement we witness today, with no doubt, is here to stay and going to drive human life and businesses on a long-term basis.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With this rapid technological advancement comes lucrative investment opportunities since IT has turned into one of the key drivers of the global economy. Today, Digital Transformation is the buzzword among most of the enterprises all over the world. Small scale industries to larger corporations are embracing technology to enhance their productivity or at least to survive in the current disruptive digital environment. The demand for the stocks of the businesses focused on digital services, Industry 4.0, Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Data Science are rising.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most of us know about the digital technology revolution and how it is going to transform the world we live in. But only a very few know how to make their wealth grow along with this inevitable technological revolution. At times, even the experienced investors, fail to pick the right technology stocks to grow their wealth. This dilemma over technology equity investment has been taken away to a greater extent by Technology Funds, the privately pooled and professionally managed funds that focus on the equity of rapidly growing Information Technology (IT) companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The investment in IT related stocks or Technology Funds would be a wise investment decision. But like any other investments, they do come with risks. Technology funds are risky in nature as their performance solely depends on the performance of the IT business sector. On the brighter side, these Technology Mutual Funds can also deliver more than 100% returns in an investment timeframe of 3 to 5 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article aims at giving an overview of the top five Technology Funds that have delivered double digit returns to investors in 2021-22 and a few factors to consider while investing in these Technology Funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>ICICI Pru Technology Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Since its launch in March 2000, ICICI Pru Technology Fund has generated 1190% returns for the investors and in last year alone, it has delivered 134% returns. Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL) has given a three-star rating for this mutual fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Managed by expert fund managers, this fund has 88.38% of its capital allocation in Indian technology stocks of which 53.61% is in large cap stocks like Infosys, HCL, TCS and Tech Mahindra. The fund allocates the remaining 8.52% and 20.12% in mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This Technology Fund that comes with a higher expense ratio is suitable for investors with up-to-date knowledge of macroeconomic trends and remains selective in picking up funds with higher returns compared to other Equity funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">ICICI Pru Technology is not suitable for risk averse investors as it may be possible that the fund can bring moderate to heavy capital drawdowns in spite of better performance of the overall market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Tata Digital India Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tata Digital India Fund, another high performing technology fund, launched in December 2015 has generated 118% returns last year. 80% of the pooled investment of Tata Digital India Fund is allocated in direct equity of large-cap IT companies such as Infosys, L&amp;T Infotech, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Persistent system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Aditya Birla Sun Life Digital India Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Aditya Birla Sun Life Digital India Fund, a higher performing Technology Fund in the country, was launched in January 2013 and has been generating double digit returns since then. CRISIL has endowed the fund with a four-star rating.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Aditya Birla Sun Life Digital India Fund focuses primarily on large-cap Indian IT companies like Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies and Cyient. Last year, the returns from this fund stood at 113% while it has generated 210% returns for the last 5 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>SBI Technology Opportunities Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">SBI Technology Opportunities Fund, an open-ended direct equity scheme in the Technology sector, is from the stable of State Bank of India Mutual Funds. The fund which was launched in January 2013 has generated 94% return for the investor in last year alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">SBI Technology Opportunities Fund comes with a slightly higher expense ratio. The fund allocates capital in Indian technology stocks as well as in international ones. Top technology stocks that have taken the major share of this fund include Infosys, TCS, HCL Technologies and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Franklin India Technology Fund</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Launched in August 1998, Franklin India Technology Fund is one of the longest running Technology Funds in the country. The major investment objective of the fund is an above average capital appreciation through investments in fastest growing IT companies. Last year, Franklin India Technology Fund generated 74% returns for the investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This fund has major investments in large-cap IT companies like Infosys, HCL and TCS. Though this fund has delivered above average returns to the investors, it has been categorized as a risky fund by various investors and rating agencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Major Factors to Consider When Investing in Technology Funds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The frequent boom and bust of technology companies will be a norm of the day in this Digital Age. The advent of disruptive technologies also adds fuel to the fire of risk in direct equity investments in the Technology sector. This simply means the technology funds are not for investors who are looking out for higher return generating lower risk investments. It is highly advisable that only the investors with higher risk profile should enter this investment arena.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Technology funds require a time frame of 5-7 years to generate higher returns. An investor should also be required to monitor the performance of these funds on a regular basis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Picking out a mutual fund would be a difficult task to some investors. A little bit of research and understanding of one&rsquo;s financial goals can solve this problem. Along with due diligence in selecting a mutual fund, an investor can also take up the service of an expert financial advisor. Or, if an investor prefers to go solo in this investment venture, it is highly advisable that he or she should take the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) route towards Technology Funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687943489/s1fnxtkn1jcjvyo2n2qe.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Top Five Technology Funds for Investment in 2021-22","seo_keywords":"The Top Five Technology Funds for Investment in 2021-22","seo_description":"The whole world is running on the shoulders of technology, particularly, since the Corona pandemic.

If you are a High Net worth Individual (HNI) still confused about how to invest your wealth, let&rsquo;s take a look at the 8 investment options that can generate higher returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Fixed-Income Funds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Fixed-income funds also known as debt funds or credit funds are the most popular and time-tested investment options. These asset classes, the darlings of the middle-class population, can also play a greater role in the diversification of large sized portfolios. These classic investment avenues consist of Fixed Deposits (FD), Triple-A (AAA) Bonds, and Government Bonds that can generate steady cash flow with higher security for your capital. The investors with a conservative risk profile can safely bet their money on fixed-income funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Direct Equity</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">After fixed-income funds, direct equity or stock market investments are the most popular investment avenues with higher returns but with higher risk. If you can invest a little bit of your time to study the fundamentals of the securities and analyse stock market trends, you can easily pick out lower risk, higher return yielding securities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you are an HNI with little time or interest to contribute towards investment research, you could always choose an expert Portfolio Manager. He can help you to pick stocks with meticulous risk assessment, and the expertise on fundamental and technical analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial markets are evolving rapidly during this digital era. Powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and algorithms predict financial market trends giving lesser room for human emotions while trading. In this scenario, if your technical expertise permits, you can deploy your own algorithms. Otherwise, it is highly advisable to get an expert quantitative trader on board to make financial market investment decisions for you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT)</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Real estate is another classic investment avenue that offers safety of your investment and yields higher returns. The dawn of the digital age has transformed this time-tested investment avenue for the better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Emulating the model of mutual funds, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) company pools the capital from various investors and invests it into income-generating real estate properties. Without bearing the pain of buying, managing, or financing any real estate properties by himself, an individual investor can earn dividends from real estate investments through REIT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As REIT companies offer real estate investments as digitized stocks that earn dividends, they offer greater liquidity &ndash; if you sell your stock, the money is credited to your bank account the very next day. It is a greater development from the traditional real estate investments that require capital intensive yet time consuming real estate deals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Currently, Mindspace Business Parks REIT, Embassy Office Parks REIT, and Brookfield India Real Estate Trust are the only three REITs available in India. In coming days, other leading names in the Real Estate Sector such as Godrej and DLF are also expected to enter the REIT arena.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Gold</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gold is another traditional investment avenue that has been greatly transformed by digitalization. Today, an investor can easily invest in digital gold or gold backed funds without worrying about the safety of holding actual gold in hand. This digital gold backed investments acts as a hedge against inflation and unpredictable financial market shocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Alternative Investment Fund (AIF)</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) is an unconventional investment avenue. It is a privately pooled fund from both Indian and foreign investors incorporated in India in accordance with a well-defined investment policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The asset classes of an AIF may include private equity, precious metals, derivative contracts, and even real estate among the few. AIF, an excellent investment option if you have an investment corpus worth a crore and above, is also a great diversification tool in a portfolio. This investment avenue showcases innovation of financial products and customized services as its hallmark features.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Private Equity</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India is a rapidly developing country that has turned into a hotbed of start-ups in various promising business sectors. Start-up culture is essential for our country&rsquo;s economic growth as well as to give wings to the dreams of the young populace. In India, there are a good number of talented and skilled entrepreneurs who face the dearth of capital to launch their promising business projects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An HNI can invest directly in a start-up or if it is the first time, he can provide capital to a start-up through a network of angel investors. HNIs can also invest in the private equity of the promoters of start-up companies and pull their money once the business project turns viable and set for Initial Public Offering (IPO). Always remember that successful private equity investments require some diligent research and market analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Antique Trade</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you are a lover of art and culture with a deep pocket; then antique trade is an excellent investment avenue for you. Artworks of renowned artists and artifacts with historical relevance are great long-term investments. Modern and contemporary arts also garner investor interest these days. Art funds, though a young investment class, offer liquidity and can also be used as a significant investment tool to diversify a portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Crypto Currency</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Crypto currencies are widely considered to be a very risky asset with tons of speculation surrounding them. The decentralization of the global financial system, and the attempts of governments worldwide to regulate the cryptocurrency market are among the few rumours in the air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Anyway, the digital age is all about decentralization and democratization of most of the traditional establishments and professional sectors. Gauging the popularity, trends and growth of disruptive technologies &mdash; cryptocurrencies, without doubt, are assets of the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is advisable that you should at least invest a tiny portion of your portfolio on the &lsquo;currency of the future&rsquo;. You can start investing in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Then add new currencies to your portfolio whenever they are introduced to the market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The truth is most of the investors are in constant watch for investment avenues that can earn over the top returns as quickly as possible. That too, without the risk of losing the principal amount. In reality, an investment product that comes along with a combination of higher return and lower risk, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t exist. Risks and returns are directly proportional in the market; that is, lower the risk, lower the return and vice versa.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The investment options described above are some of the best investment classes available in the market today. But, like every other investment venture, they have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is highly advisable that an investor should always choose the assets and allocate the capital carefully in accordance with his financial goals and risk profile.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ndash; Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687944830/aicldrjchfaskfyegd3x.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"8 Investment Options with Higher Returns for HNIs","seo_keywords":"8 Investment Options with Higher Returns for HNIs","seo_description":"It is a matter of common sense that both active and passive investing are two proven ways to grow your money rather than keeping it idle in a savings bank account.

It was proposed by the Finance Act of 2015. Recently, the Budget 2019 introduced a broad 22 percent rise in surcharge rates for individuals with taxable income of more than ₹5 crores. The tax proposal has widened the tax bracket for HNIs to nearly 43%. These adverse Indian taxation policies on HNIs have made most of them look out for other ways to transfer their revenue sources and financial assets, particularly to tax haven countries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Yes, death and taxes are certain. Though we can&rsquo;t save ourselves from death, in the case of taxes, we can save a great deal of it through proper financial planning.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here are some legitimate ways for the HNIs to save tax on their revenue from various asset classes.</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Equity Investment</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian equity market, with a total market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, offers a number of tax saver financial instruments. Equity investments in listed securities for more than a year and long-term investments in debt instruments (Bonds, Debentures, Certificates of Deposit, etc.) for more than three years generate revenue as long-term capital gains and dividends. Both revenues are tax-free in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Informed equity investment decisions can provide a tax-saving investment opportunity with greater liquidity. Consider a fixed deposit of ₹1 lakh with a Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) of three years. An investor who comes under the 30 percent tax bracket invites a tax amount of more than ₹10,000 for the mentioned fixed deposit scheme. On the other hand, if the same amount of money is invested in a debt mutual fund with a 3-year FMP, the investor has to pay only a meager sum of ₹600.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Equity investments, though an attractive investment option for HNIs, are not for investors with a conventional mindset and greatly rely on the investor&rsquo;s risk appetite.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Home Loans</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A home loan is a hidden tax-saving tool for HNIs that can also help them to build their wealth. Section 24 of the Income Tax Act allows the deduction of interest up to ₹2 lakhs on home loans as a tax rebate. High net-worth individuals with more than one residential property with rental provisions can take home huge tax savings as the standard 30 percent tax deduction is allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Non-Resident External (NRE) and Foreign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) Deposits</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A risk-averse non-resident Indian HNI with a deep pocket and a keen eye on tax benefits can plan for NRE or FCNR term deposits in India that can also earn tax-exempt interest. However, the investor should evaluate the tax implication of his or her country of residence regarding these international investments.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Bonus Stripping</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bonus stripping is a tax-saving practice in which an investor buys mutual fund units or shares of a company that has announced a stock bonus. He or she later sells the shares soon after the bonus date and books a notional loss. This notional loss can legitimately be adjusted against the short-term or long-term capital gain from any financial assets of the investor. The Income Tax Act of India provides the provision to carry forward this unadjusted loss for up to eight financial years. This is a good tax-saving strategy for HNIs who come under a higher tax bracket.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Under the Income Tax Act of India, HUF is considered a separate legal entity that invites income tax only at individual levels. Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs are entitled to form HUFs in India. The income from the assets like ancestral property or a will, life insurance policy, and salary of its members receives tax deductions under section 80C of the Income Tax Act of India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">HNIs with entrepreneurial itch can consider setting up companies as LLPs. LLPs enjoy separate legal entity status and open various ways to infuse capital into the partnership. Partners to the LLP can invest in their company via revenues from their property, loans from banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), or monetary donations. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms have been relaxed, over the years, for LLPs allowing hassle-free investment avenues for non-resident HNIs. Additionally, income distribution among the LLP partners is exempted from tax. LLPs enjoy a tax rate of about 35%, while HNIs generally are entitled to the current income tax rate of 43%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The LLP structure has been widely accepted among professionals and entrepreneurs alike for its tax efficiency. All these tax benefits and ease of administration of the LLP structure boosted its popularity in the investment world. Coupled with increased efficiency and cost savings, the LLP structure stands as a bridge for new-age entrepreneurs to sail smoothly through the current tumultuous pandemic days and firmly on the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; post-pandemic entrepreneurial era.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Family Trust</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A family trust is a permanent institution independent of its beneficiaries that enjoys greater flexibility in managing its assets, be it investments, acquisitions, disposals, or any other financial dealings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In a family trust, &lsquo;settlors&rsquo; transfer the assets and revenue to the &lsquo;trustee&rsquo; who is held responsible for the benefit of the &lsquo;beneficiaries&rsquo;. In a typical family trust structure, every asset of the trust, including residential properties, cash, bank deposits, and shares, can be transferred to the beneficiaries in a tax-free mode. Along with upholding family harmony, a family trust can preserve wealth, protect assets, and restrict third-party involvement in the family business. However, the revenue earned by the family trust will be taxed as per the specific and discretionary nature of the trust.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The efficiency and convenience of family trusts are gaining popularity nowadays. If structured and maintained prudently, a family trust can be a great institution that can efficiently manage assets, finances, equity investments, and revenue earned by the family trust to benefit its beneficiaries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The entire investment world is significantly transforming, and now is the time to rethink and plan your investments wisely yet legitimately.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687945117/ialxynh29cotcbfqrhff.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"A Few Tax Saver Investment Routes for High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs)","seo_keywords":"A Few Tax Saver Investment Routes for High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs)","seo_description":"Individuals with a taxable income of ₹ one crore or above – High Net worth Individuals or HNIs – are entitled to a two percent additional surcharge.

It all started in 1973 when Princeton University professor Burton Malkiel claimed that a &ldquo;blindfolded monkey could throw darts randomly and select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Then in 1999, a chimpanzee actress named Raven&nbsp;rose to fame when her ten dartboard picks reportedly quadrupled the performance of the Dow and doubled the performance of the Nasdaq composite.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2010, a&nbsp;Russian circus monkey&nbsp;named Lusha picked an investment portfolio that &ldquo;outperformed 94% of the country&rsquo;s investment funds&rdquo; to great acclaim. In 2013, Orlando the cat, a fierce new competitor, joined the rest of them in stock picking.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Hearing these stories added fuel to the lockdown boredom, powered by the rise of DIY platforms and trading apps. Thousands have started dabbling in the stock market actively. Most of them have made a killing from the one-way ride over the past 18 months.&nbsp; More often than not, many confuse this winning streak for talent. As a result, many investors prefer to invest directly in stocks.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, nothing lasts forever!! Consider the other side of the story of our dartboard investors.&nbsp; Where there is extra return, there&rsquo;s usually an additional risk. For instance, in 2000, when the trend in the market reversed, Raven faced severe losses than the professionals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here, I agree with Chris Sacca</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687945696/e1tjieeacvbaa3htrx6h.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 515px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It makes the trick behind this dartboard investing clear. Any portfolio of randomly selected stocks from the universe is bound to include mostly smaller companies. Since small companies have more risk than the market as a whole, they were able to beat the market in the bull run.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Academia recognizes the small-cap premium (Fama French asset pricing model eloquently deconstructs it). Small stocks offer an extra return for taking the additional risk. These companies may not be well known, global, or well-capitalized. They often pay more for borrowing money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">More often than not, bull markets are characterized by irrational exuberance. Psychological effects and speculation also play a prominent role in the markets. Typically, companies that are a few notches below in the quality curve run the fastest in a bull run.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you are someone who is longing for experimentation and turning life experiences into learnings, then maybe this time around, you learn from someone else&rsquo;s mistake (and avoid making expensive errors yourself)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We simulated the dart-throwing monkey model for Indian market by randomly selecting stocks from the one listed on the exchange over 2015 till now. In the next step, we create equally weighted portfolio and repeat this exercise over different periods. Next, we compare the average return of the random stock portfolio with a portfolio of&nbsp; ten diversified mutual fund schemes and the market benchmark &ndash; Nifty 50.&nbsp; Results are offered in the table. Amazed? Shocked? Surprised? We all were.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687945719/bwliecp28quvzranxvac.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 328px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I would request your attention to 3rd row (Jan 2018 &ndash; March 2020), which was different from all the other periods and which highlighted the huge drawdown in random portfolio.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Till the time market rally continues, investors with a random portfolio may benefit. Still, as soon as the trend reverses, one should be prepared for the volatility to play out.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another figure to note is the return 10 MF scheme portfolio offers for Jan 2015 till now. It will not be wrong to say that 10 MF scheme portfolio gives consistent return with lower volatility vis a vis random portfolio (as per expectations)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To cut a long story short, invest in asset classes that reflect your personal ability to withstand volatility. It&rsquo;s not about a choice of investing directly (DIY) or indirectly. Both approaches are not at odds with each other. You can do both focusing on how to derive maximum benefit. Identify gaps in the current portfolio and fill them with exposure to countries and sectors that the portfolio currently lacks. Current euphoria is scary; Play it safe, plan how you will act in a bear market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Supported by Manjeet Singh for Data Analysis</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687945791/k1paida8dppeyhyjz5ql.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Investing – Join the circus!!","seo_keywords":"Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Investing – Join the circus!!","seo_description":"Let me share an interesting story with you all.

Be it the Olympics, UEFA, or Cricket. Tokyo Olympics 2020 is the talk of the town. Indian Olympic Team is doing wonders, and our Indian Hockey Team, today defeated Germany to win an Olympic medal after 41 Years.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sports are essential &ndash; not only for physical fitness (which is very important) but also for imparting some key life lessons. It teaches how to be a team player, sportsmanship, discipline and the importance of consistency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Stop staring at your portfolio.</strong>&nbsp;</span>When my inner sports enthusiasts meet the investor in me, I cannot help but observe simple principles common to both. In my young days, I would frantically scrutinize every game, player, and strategy. Similarly, in my initial days of investing, I would track my investment portfolio day in and day out in an attempt to time the market. Often, the fervent fan and a biased investor overpowered my rational thinking. The logic was left far behind, especially when faced with a loss.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Know your time horizon.</strong>&nbsp;</span>For any sportsman, the objective is to win. For any investor, the aim is to maximize return and attain financial goals. When players are picked up for a team &ndash; their past and current performance, track record, etc., are studied carefully. A choice is made based on the requirements of the different formats in cricket &ndash; ODI, T 20, or test match.&nbsp; Time horizon is critical. Similarly, some asset classes are best suited for a short time horizon and some long-term.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Diversify according to your goals.&nbsp;</strong></span>A look at our cricket team or football team would also underscore the importance of diversification in our investment portfolio. Each player has a role &ndash; its unique role to play in the game. (Remember the 2011 movie &ndash; Moneyball &ndash; how a baseball team is assembled using a computer-generated analysis to acquire new players &ndash; Watch it on Netflix if you have missed it). Similarly, the debt portion of our investment portfolio is for safety and capital protection; equity is for growth; gold is for hedging; cash and liquid investment is for liquidity. Solely relying on fixed income instruments will not give the best result in times of growth but when the market corrects, it is the debt instruments that provide a cushion to the portfolio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Mental strength is important.&nbsp;</strong></span>A gymnast wins not only because of the strenuous physical training but also because of tremendous control over the mind and flexible body.&nbsp; One needs to be mentally strong when making investment decisions and not be swayed by emotions and biases. When an athlete runs, it&rsquo;s the speed, endurance, and patience that results in success. Like a marathon, investments often are meant for the long term, which requires patience, and often the investor gives up just before the finishing line. Reckless batting is never desirable &ndash; losing wickets could translate into losing the match too.&nbsp; Similarly, poor investment decisions might result in losses and even capital erosion. One should always make an investment decision based on thorough analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Be flexible.</strong></span>&nbsp;A player who can make changes in the playing style as per the changed format is the one who emerges victorious. Similarly, an investor needs to be flexible as per different financial goals and make asset classes choice. Changing economic and financial environment warrants an investor to review the decisions made in the past and be flexible in asset allocation. A good player should have the ability to hit sixes and consistent running between the wickets to win the game. A single strategy is not necessarily the best way &ndash; neither for a sports player nor the investor. One needs to be flexible in changing the game and making choices according to different time horizons.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Continue that monthly SIP/ STP.</span>&nbsp;</strong>The ability to finish the race is vital. The winner will be the one who can withstand unfavourable situations and crosses the rocky/ bumpy road leading to the finish line with composure and not panic. A winner investor will be the one who is not going to lose sight of the financial goals during the market correction or heightened uncertainty (like the one we are facing in the COVID times).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>―&nbsp;</em><em>Benjamin Graham,&nbsp;</em><em>The Intelligent Investor</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Start early.&nbsp;</strong></span>In the game of cricket, an early catch often influences the final match result. On the same lines, an early start to investing also bears a considerable influence on the final corpus accumulated and how soon you attain your financial goal. An early start provides the scarcest resource &ndash;&nbsp;<strong><em>TIME</em></strong>&nbsp;(to see the power of Compounding, the 8th wonder)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Know your game well.</strong></span>&nbsp;Understanding the game &ndash; rules, strategies, environment, and participants will always work in your favour. Like a true fan, don&rsquo;t despise the game but live to watch it win</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear readers, let&rsquo;s not be a sports fan who discards idol with every game and creates a new one. Just like one game doesn&rsquo;t define the player, one market slump cannot determine the credibility of the investment decision. It is over a period of time when the true character is shown. Do analyze long term performance, including at least one market downturn. Look for consistency in its performance and vis a vis peer. Only invest if it aligns with your long-term financial goal, not just because it is popular.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Congratulations to our Hockey Team and all of us.

IoT improves performance of the device, fuel efficiency, economic benefits and brings down human involvement in operating these devices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The vast potential of IoT along with impending widespread usage of 5G technology has already been leveraged by most modern enterprises to simplify and automate most of their routine tasks.

The heavy weight plunge also brought the Hang Seng Tech index to 7,321.98, a 3.71% drop on an index that represents the 30 technology giants with highest stock market exposure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei 225 and Topix Index witnessed 0.88% and 0.9% decline, respectively. The Kospi in South Korea closed at 3,252.6 with a decline of 0.99%. MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares recorded a 1.6% slump.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Major Chinese shares also bear the brunt of the bloodbath on Chinese tech stocks. The Shanghai composite fell to 3,525.50, taking a heavy 0.79% punch while the Shenzhen component collapsed to 14,882.90, a 0.382% decline.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Trigger Behind the Recent Chinese Tech Stocks&rsquo; Drop</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The resurface of regulatory fears is cited as the cause of the recent drop in Chinese tech stocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And, why do investors fear the new Chinese regulations on its tech companies?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">During recent years, technology giants like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have grown into some of the world&rsquo;s most valuable companies mostly through the loopholes of the feeble Chinese regulatory framework.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But since 2017, China&rsquo;s foggy digital technology regulatory landscape has begun to transform when Cybersecurity Law was passed by the Chinese government.&nbsp; On June 10, 2021, the Data Security Law (DSL) was implemented by China with new rules on the collection, storage, process, and transfer of data by the technology companies in the country. To grant more control for users over their data, a Personal Information Protection Law is also underway in legislation procedure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Data drives the technology industry and economic growth in the digital age. Chinese regulators keep a keen eye on the supervision of the domestic tech firms listed overseas, mainly because of data security and cross-border data leaks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Beijing&rsquo;s focus has very much been on the regulation of financial technology and to crack the monopoly of these technology players. The recent announcement of Beijing to step up the regulation over the Chinese listings in the U.S. stock market brought a heavy blow on tech companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Chinese authorities, citing antitrust and data security concerns, have been bringing strict restrictions on its native technology giants over the last few months. The nullification of $34.5 billion worth listing of Ant Group and an antitrust penance worth $2.8 billion on Alibaba are some noteworthy events.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On Friday, 2nd of July, Didi Chuxing, a Beijing based ride hailing giant, was brought under regulatory investigation alleging that the company carried out illegal collection and usage of personal data. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), rumoured to be a watchdog of Chinese President Xi Jinping, ordered the removal of Didi&rsquo;s mobile application from Chinese app stores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">All these fateful events happened just four days after the shares of Didi had been ushered to the New York Stock Exchange, raising $4.4 billion in an Initial Public Offering that took the value of the company at $67.5 billion. On 6th of July, the regulatory action brought a massive decline of nearly 20% on Didi shares.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To add fuel to the fire, on Monday, 5th of July, CAC initiated a cybersecurity probe into Boss Zhipin, a US listed company, and Full Truck Alliance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On 8th of July, all these perilous events gradually culminated as an abrupt collapse of the value of Chinese tech stocks in broader Asia-Pacific financial markets including Hang Seng Index.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The Good Investment Opportunities Hiding Behind the Recent Crash of Chinese Tech Stocks</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&ldquo;Predicting the future is difficult&rdquo;, says Alexander Davey of HSBC Global Asset Management. He urges the investors to look at the valuations of the tech companies with discipline. &ldquo;The timing is more important than the nerve of the investor. Fundamentally, it is a very strong business (technology)&rdquo;, Davey concludes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The boom and bust on the price levels is just the noise. The dubious concern over increased Chinese regulatory scrutiny is going to linger on for a short period. According to Alexander Davey, the technology companies with strong fundamentals offer buying opportunities whenever their stock prices drop amid investor fears.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In today&rsquo;s Information Age, technology drives the future of every enterprise.

This unique macroeconomic situation keeps the door of the Chinese market wide open for local online companies that provide services like ecommerce, entertainment, social media, and online content.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The lower penetration of most Chinese tech companies offers a lot of potential for growth. Today, China leads the world in online payments and is better equipped to transform itself to a cashless society than other countries in the world. The Chinese tech companies have developed more diversified revenue streams that can be more defensive in the future than their Western counterparts. Moreover, an unprecedented rate of growth of China&rsquo;s middle class set the growing user base for these online services.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Greater GDP Growth and Impressive Infrastructure</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to the World Bank, China showcased 10% average GDP growth since 1978 representing nearly 19% of the world&rsquo;s population. The infrastructure development in China is expected to continue at its current phase past 2030.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Growing Disposable Income</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The growing Chinese middle class increases the rate of disposable income in the country. IPOs issued by many rapidly growing Chinese tech companies on US exchanges provided them with the access to global investors that drove large chunks of investment capital to China.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Today, the Chinese tech giants may not be garnering enough media attention like Silicon Valley tech giants do, but in the near future, chances are high that the most valuable company in the world might be one of these Chinese tech giants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Cons</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Trade Wars and Communist Regime</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Like some of the prominent global tech companies are banned in China, certain Chinese tech companies like Huawei and online services like TikTok have been banned in several other countries. This along with the ongoing trade wars between the U.S. and China poses investment risk in Chinese tech companies. The totalitarian, communist regime also raises concerns on the long-term economic growth of the country and its relationship with the world economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Low Standards in Bookkeeping and Accounting</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Low bookkeeping and accounting standards in China is a fertile ground for Ponzi Schemes, insider trading and financial frauds. This situation demands greater attention from the investor to conduct an in-depth study of the fundamentals of the tech company he plans to invest in.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Justin Raj</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687946849/dhwb5qpcceswyjecmrjr.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Recent Drop in Chinese Tech Stocks and Investment Opportunities Hiding Behind It","seo_keywords":"The Recent Drop in Chinese Tech Stocks and Investment Opportunities Hiding Behind It","seo_description":"In the afternoon trade in the Hong Kong stock market, shares of Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan plunged 3.74%, 4.13% and 6.43% respectively.

In India, IPOs of Reliance Power, DLF, Gammon Infra have all destroyed investors&rsquo; wealth in the past. Nevertheless, during this gloom and doom story, IPO of companies with solid business fundamentals have fared well in the markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947010/upw9ottirws2azfmqmnw.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 705px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The present IPO avalanche has been triggered by a strong bull run in the Indian stock market.&nbsp;Increased liquidity, owing to money being pumped in by the central bank and the government, rising capital flows, and previous IPO success stories have contributed to this optimism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In a bull market, people want to latch on to a good brand and have an exciting story. This, coupled with relaxed SEBI norms, has led to an IPO Boom, which is hard to ignore. Moreover, one can see an incredible increase in the number and size of issues globally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947035/fvfu07ahjc2xm1apwh3p.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 660px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As this euphoria peaks, investors pay little attention to valuations amid a media frenzy, turning this IPO boom into IPO mania. Familiarity bias and herd mentality overcome the rationality while investing in IPOs. Retail investors hear, see these names day in and day out in the ordinary course of a day. Familiarity bias quickly leads to consumers becoming shareholders too. But it&rsquo;s essential to remember that not all companies are investment-worthy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These days one is flooded with IPO news &ndash; newspapers, experts at news channels, emails, social media &ndash; essentially everywhere. It becomes increasingly difficult to resist participating in them. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and herd mentality catch up with the investor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In a bull market, an increased number of IPOs leaves investors with hardly any time or resources to analyze offers. Not only this, the information access to the retail investor is limited.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A good company comes out with an IPO. It gets hugely oversubscribed, and allotment is not guaranteed for all retail investors (such a waste of time and effort). The word of caution for the investors is to not be lured with the mirage of listing gains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947058/evqskb3sxqqujxogv4ux.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 744px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One should never forget that IPOs are never meant to be cheap. A team of well-qualified people out there is paid to sell the IPO to the investors at the highest possible price, thus making the odds of you losing your money much more elevated. Data highlights that the odds of winning to losing in IPOs are 40:60 for the last decade. As a result, value investors like Warren Buffet generally dismiss IPO as a gamble.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Always invest for the long-term prospects, looking at the fundamentals. And if the company is good, good opportunities will always exist post listing too. Either buy it in the secondary market post listing or invest in mutual fund schemes to benefit . Don&rsquo;t rush into an IPO.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be mindful that whenever one invests in a new company, be it through a pre IPO, an IPO, or post-IPO, what determines returns is the Quality of Business, Growth prospects and Valuations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Zomato, in its DRHP, said it expects costs to increase over time. &ldquo;Our losses will continue, given significant investments expected towards growing our business.&rdquo; As a result, Zomato will have to be valued differently. Zomato and other startups (barring NYKAA) planning to list in the coming months are still in the phase where the companies are burning money. Up till now, these companies have been valued based on the future projections and hope to become profitable soon. But it may have to happen quickly to justify the stock market valuation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors might also change the lens while valuing such stocks. For example, Dalal Street has always approached stocks based on net profit, EBITDA, discounted cash flows, etc. However, absolute valuation metrics do not hold ground for loss-making new-age tech firms. Moreover, relative valuation is also challenging as hardly any tech companies are listed on Indian bourses to compare.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the most famous cases to be quoted in the startup space is AMAZON. It is the most competent example that shows that losses might lead to revenues<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;HBR mentions that Amazon trained its investors how to behave and taught Wall Street. Amazon was listed in its early stages; as a result, investors showed patience for more than two decades for Amazon to be profitable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Because the Indian unicorns have existed for a reasonably long time, investors probably would not be willing to ignore the profitability for too long. The emergent need to evolve new parameters for valuing the new-age tech firms appropriately in the evolving scenario cannot be overlooked.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, how does one values a loss-making firm? The answer to this question can be found in the way private equity/ venture capitalists perform valuations. Several methods exist like &ndash; Berkus method, venture capital method and scorecard method.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947087/ce2lgk4pfqtmzgacvjsx.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 270px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Simply put, invest when you believe that in the long run these tech firms will graduate to a profitable, sustainable enterprise to survive and deliver returns to investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For assessing this, look at customer lifetime value (LTV), customer acquisition costs (CAC), the payback period on CAC (The money you spend at this stage will be made back over the lifecycle of each customer), average revenue per user (ARPU), repeat user rate, etc. makes more sense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unit economics is the new mantra &ndash; where the focus is on profitability on a per-unit basis. The point to note is that the new economy stocks are valued at multiple of revenues, not profits. Keep in mind the stage in which the startup company is for defining growth milestones. Look at the market potential (TAM/SAM/SOM, trends, drivers), competitive advantage (IP, partnerships, clients, competitors). Value of founding team, promoters is crucial &ndash;&nbsp; proven experience and commitment would impact its trajectory to success.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947109/susw9lxzcmnbrincukkt.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 613px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear investors, whatever be the strategy, certain factors are imperative. Fundamentals are essential, whichever lens is used to value. Read the DHRP (though tedious), analyze the fundamentals (using any method you like), and be rational while investing (beware of familiarity bias and herd mentality). Identify IPOs to create wealth, not to destroy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687947217/ztxe7ex0iczc9btjqpzf.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Unicorns Knocking at the Dalal Street","seo_keywords":"Unicorns Knocking at the Dalal Street","seo_description":"As this euphoria peaks, investors pay little attention to valuations amid a media frenzy, turning this IPO boom into IPO mania.

A portfolio with international investments gives the investor exposure to both developed and emerging markets. It also provides wider room for diversification.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What Is International Portfolio Management?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">International portfolio includes stocks, bonds, cash, or other portfolio assets in a foreign country purchased by a non-resident through a cross-border transaction. For instance, if an investor based in India bought shares in a Japan based company, it would be considered as a foreign portfolio investment. It is different from Foreign Direct Investment or FDI &ndash; a financing endeavour of a non-resident to an enterprise in a foreign country solely to obtain an ownership stake or some degree of business management control.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Why Foreign Portfolio Investment Important?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A well-designed foreign portfolio investment is very significant in today&rsquo;s highly volatile domestic and international markets. Every investment comes with a risk &ndash; both depreciation and volatility risks. An astute investor should take considerable effort to add additional wealth creation sources in his portfolio while diversifying the investment risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Foreign portfolio investment provides an excellent arena for both wealth creation and diversification. The global financial markets go through numerous yielding, stagnant and losing investment time periods spread across wide geographical areas and economic systems. It provides a wider room for risk management and wealth creation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every single economy comes with a wide variety of investment opportunities. For instance, while Indian economy is dominated by Information Technology and Oil &amp; Gas, international markets like the US are driven by Artificial Intelligence, industrial automation, and block chain. So foreign portfolio investment provides the investor with a greater exposure to both old and digital economy themes. It also offers freedom to the investor for wider asset allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Benefits Of International Portfolio Investment</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here are some of the benefits of international portfolio investment worth considering before taking the plunge.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Mitigation Of Both Depreciation and Volatility Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A well-diversified foreign portfolio mitigates investment risk. If the domestic assets in a portfolio underperforms, it can be compensated by the gains in the foreign investments in the portfolio. A good symmetry between assets from both developed and emerging markets in an international portfolio is a great hedge against the uncertainty in the domestic investment sphere.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Diversification of Currency Value Risk</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">An investor purchases stocks, bonds or other assets in an international portfolio using the currency of the respective country. For example, if an investor purchases shares in London Stock Exchange, he uses British Pound as the medium of transaction. Thus, the ups and downs of British Pound can bring volatility to the value of the stock he purchased. The volatility of the US dollar, in general, affects every international asset in a portfolio across the globe. The investments made in different currencies in different countries can mitigate currency value risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Varying Market Cycles</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Market cycles vary in different countries or economies. An avid investor who manages an international portfolio can take advantage of this varying market cycles. An investor who identifies market tops or overvaluation in US stocks or dollars can divert his investments to developing economies like Latin America or Asia. It can aid capital inflow and supply-demand factors in that economy as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Well-Diversified Portfolio</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Foreign portfolio investment offers a unique opportunity for the investor to diversify the portfolio assets on a global scale that, in turn, empowers the portfolio to achieve a higher risk-adjusted return. The macroeconomic factors that drive the financial markets all over the world vary at any given time. This factor gives lesser volatility for a portfolio with foreign investments than the one which focuses only on domestic assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Wider Credit Base</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A foreign portfolio investor has access to credit sources of the foreign countries in which he has investments. It can be greatly beneficial when his domestic credit sources turn expensive or unavailable. The availability of the credit determines the ability of a business to expand its operations and to invest in new projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Exchange Rate Benefits</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Currency exchange rates fluctuate every single second, seven days a week, 365 days a year, all over the world without a holiday. The currency rates can turn weak or strong in accordance with ever-changing global political and economic factors. A foreign portfolio investor can greatly benefit from the stronger currency exchange rate of the foreign country in which his portfolio operates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>A Wider Market</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wider the market, less the competition and volatility. Domestic markets are highly competitive as most of the companies offer similar products and services. On the other hand, foreign markets offer wider headspace for the investor and lesser competition for the companies that gives away greater opportunities for diversification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Liquidity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The easy buying and selling of an asset in a portfolio is carried out by the liquidity offered by the cash market. Higher liquidity boosts the buying power of investors. Foreign portfolio investors are blessed with higher liquidity offered by international cash markets. A ready cash flow enables a foreign portfolio investor to tap a profitable investment opportunity as soon as it arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Risks of International Diversification</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nothing comes without a risk in the portfolio management universe. The trump card of an investor that determines the success or failure of his investments including international portfolio investment is his risk management skill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here are some of the risks associated with international portfolio investment and how to tackle it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>An Efficient Flow of Information.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The flow of information plays a critical role in an information age. Financial markets in developed nations like the US have very efficient information flow. As a result, active market funds, most of the time, fail to consistently outperform the benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Standard Poor&rsquo;s Index Versus Active (SPIVA) 2020 report states that active large-cap funds have underperformed the S &amp; P 500 for the past 11 years in a row. It not only brings greater risk of depreciation but also carries higher cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To eliminate the depreciation risk and bring down the transaction cost, passive investment products like Exchange Traded Funds or an ETF would be better suited as an asset in a foreign portfolio. Further, passive investments mitigate the fund manager risk that can result in underperformance. It also provides an opportunity for an investor to invest a large amount of money through mutual fund route or as little installments through Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) or Systematic Transfer Plan (STP).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Political and Economic Instability.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Political and economic scenarios change with the countries. Developing or emerging countries don&rsquo;t have the similar political and economic stability of developed nations. A political coup, civil war or a rumour of a Ponzi Scheme can bring 50% drawdown in an international portfolio. Many risk-averse investors can&rsquo;t tolerate the political and economic instability in many countries all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Higher Transaction Costs</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Higher commission and brokerage charges along with taxes, stamp duties and exchange fees should be paid by the investors when they buy and sell international financial assets in their portfolio.

All of these have indeed become a fad and are inching up in the investment avenues ladder, despite tough competition from traditional asset classes like equity, debt, gold, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687948375/cq5zhkttxuago9zpnkre.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 675px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Though investing in them blindly may not be a wise financial strategy for most investors, learning about the phenomenon can help understand the risks associated with the stock market. Overlooking the impact of the new developments could potentially be an expensive oversight.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Meme (pronounced as &lsquo;meem&rsquo;) is ubiquitous in today&rsquo;s digital world. Social media plays a highly influential, dominant role in our lives, leading these memes to permeate our financial world. One can see several posts on Twitter, Reddit, and several other platforms relating to different stocks and other asset classes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Defining meme stocks is not easy (at least not in the same manner as growth and value stocks discussed in textbooks). Meme stocks are often characterized as overpriced and highly volatile stocks (high speculative interest). Their valuations are done based on the future potential and not the fundamentals in their true sense. However, what dominates everything else is the sentiment of the small number of players in the market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In short, meme stock would be any stock that can be artificially manipulated in the trading world. These stocks often find their place in trading-related posts on social media platforms, online discussion forums, news articles, etc., and popular among younger traders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It will not be entirely correct to assume that all the meme stocks (probably some) are trash, not to forget the GameStop episode in Jan 2021. But, all of them are riding on media attention. These stocks&rsquo; attention is often due to their presence in the future relevant industry or a new visionary CEO. The problem with the meme stocks is often that the price changes soon outpace their fundamentals, attributed to two factors &ndash; inexpensive trading and online investing groups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The trading volume explodes due to the social media frenzy. It brings to the forefront the power of the crowd, coupled with unprecedented coordination among the investor&rsquo;s actions. The undertone behind this phenomenon is the tug of war between small retail investors and big institutional investors, disrupting the power dynamics of the stock market, transitioning the power. It shows the amount of change that can occur when the 99% (small investors) band together against the 1% (institutional players). The belief that till the time like-minded small investors stick together, they&rsquo;ll be able to protect each other and the stock&rsquo;s price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The best game plan for meme stock investing is identifying the difference between deserved hype and hot air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, it becomes challenging when the celebrities support these meme stocks. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has become the most significant influencer with his posts on Twitter. Brief History of Elon Musk&rsquo;s Recent Market-Moving Tweets &ndash;&nbsp; be it &ldquo;use signal&rdquo;; &ldquo;Gamestonk!!&rdquo;; &ldquo;Sandstorm is a masterpiece.&rdquo;; &ldquo;Ethereum&rdquo;; &ldquo;One Word: Doge&rdquo;; &ldquo;Dogecoin is the people&rsquo;s crypto&rdquo;; &ldquo;ultimate hodler&rdquo;; among others. (PS: HODL is not a typo &ndash; but means &ldquo;hold on for dear life&rdquo; in the crypto space)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This article would be incomplete without the mention of Dogecoin (Shiba Inu), a meme coin. It started as a joke, about a meme, with a dog in it on December 6, 2013. So why are we talking about it when there is Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency to discuss?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The main reason is that this meme coin has witnessed a rise of more than 800% in January 2021 in only 24 hours. As a result, it reached the highest price of $ 0.74 on May 7, 2021 (more than 13000% gain in 2021 itself) and was the fourth-largest crypto in terms of market cap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687948402/utj4kpq9yc1fen7numxf.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 661px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Source: coinmarketcap.com</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Don&rsquo;t you find it mind-boggling that an eight-year-old Dogecoin is as big as household names like ITC or Ferrari in market cap? Of course, it will be impossible to ignore the rise of cryptocurrencies, which is soon becoming a part of the everyday vocabulary of the millennials and many of the boomers (older generation).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptos are in vogue primarily because of the astronomical rise in their price and their growing utilities. For example, in May 2021, India received a donation of more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins. However, it led to a price fall and raised concerns among policymakers, who are already wary of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, there is a lot of skepticism around it in the absence of a stable legal framework in India. Therefore, it is expected that the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, will see the light of the day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">I am sure cryptocurrencies often cross our minds when planning investments. But still, we disregard it either because we think it&rsquo;s illegal or due to lack of awareness. So at the outset, one should know that cryptocurrencies are not banned as an asset class but as a legal tender. Like all new trends, developments in the crypto space will be a thing to pay attention to and may tempt some to participate in the frenzy, but not blindly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Therefore, it is a good idea to acquire knowledge before testing the waters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another buzzword is NFT, Non-Fungible Token, a new digital asset class that lives in the blockchain ecosystem. NFTs can be anything digital (such as drawings, music, tweet, and much more). Nyan Cat, the First tweet of twitter&rsquo;s founder &ndash; Jack Dorsey &ndash; on sale, are a few famous examples of NFTs. The use of technology to sell digital art contributes a lot to the emergence of NFT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Art as an alternative asset class has often been incorporated into portfolios for diversification because of its low correlation with the equities market. But, the volatility, irrationality, and illiquidity of the art market make it hard to compare with more conventional investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As an investment opportunity, NFT, like any other speculative asset, makes sense only when considering its resale value, hoping the price will go up in the future. Thus, the payoff depends on the price you pay to acquire the NFT and how much more you can sell it for if at all you can sell it in the future. Globally, platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, Grimes&rsquo; choice, Nifty Gateway, etc. These allow people to buy and sell NFTs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unfortunately, this is relatively a new investment avenue with no guidelines on how to value these NFT (how much a meme or a GIF, or a tweet is worth).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So dear investors, maybe it&rsquo;s time to get acquainted with the new members in the investment world &ndash; it may not taste for now, but it&rsquo;s good to be aware of the season&rsquo;s flavor. Always invest in what you know, enhance your knowledge, broaden your investment horizon, diversify your portfolio and limit your exposure. Those with a greater risk appetite may consider investing about 2-5% of their portfolio in meme-stocks or meme-coins. They are the future for sure &ndash; so may ride on cautiously!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687948502/kpvd0mwgwc7jabkfvf7h.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Evolving Investment Demographics – Meme Stocks, Cryptos and NFTs","seo_keywords":"The Evolving Investment Demographics – Meme Stocks, Cryptos and NFTs","seo_description":"2021 is not the typical regular year in any sense, much like its predecessor.

Thus, challenging the foundations of the established economic and financial theory, rationality in the decision making.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For the traditional models to work, investors must update his/her belief accurately on receiving new information. &nbsp;Investor&rsquo;s inattention to the relevant news may result in underreaction. For instance, the frog-in-the-pan hypothesis states that investors under-react when small amounts of information arrive in the market relative to large quantities of information arrival.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Focusing on these cognitive and emotional aspects helps in investigating actual financial behavior and is vital for success. An important question to be asked is &ndash; Whether the popular news is relevant news or not. Is it just the media attention driving investment decisions? Is the return on any investment asset the result of new information being conveyed?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One strand of theoretical literature also explores the&nbsp;<strong>no-media premium</strong>. With less visibility and less media coverage, neglected stocks often earn more than the recognized stocks to compensate their investors for being imperfectly diversified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is easy to gauge investors&rsquo; attention by looking at the google search volumes and trends. Investors exhibit &lsquo;limited attention&rsquo; behavior, and financial intermediaries predict this behavior and exploit it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">More often than not,&nbsp;<strong>familiarity bias</strong>&nbsp;is at play. Even if international investing options (with noticeable diversification gains) are available, the investors prefer &lsquo;familiar&rsquo; investments of their own country, region, state, or company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With an influx of information and misinformation, the&nbsp;<strong>Gambler&rsquo;s Fallacy</strong>&nbsp;plays out, where investors see patterns where none exist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So dear investors, you may follow the following tips for surviving this pandemic as well as the infodemic (which may be more damaging than the pandemic itself, causing panic)&nbsp; that is all around us:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do not spend too much time on social media, and do not believe in any unverified information.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Keep up with the basics and know that common sense trumps everything else.

Life has changed a lot in past few months. Death is no more an abstraction for most of us, it has hit us very closely by impacting our near and dear ones. People across all age groups, and more recently the younger ones, too are getting severely impacted by the pandemic. We all plan and invest for the future &ndash; our future, our children&rsquo;s better future. Is the heightened uncertainties, like the one being witnesses currently, calls for changing the plan?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The idea of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), originated in the 1990s, adhered to delayed gratification. The individuals of this thought process saved roughly about 50% of the monthly income for 20 -30 years to meet their goal of creating a sufficient retirement corpus. This need is different for each individual based on current income, geographic location, the investment mix (faith in the stock market!).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687949822/epr6m9w85mjlrqkhqywj.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 846px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The pandemic has brought in extreme uncertainties, the approach of YOLO (You Only Live Once) is the new mindset. The focus has shifted from the destination to the journey. People want to live their best life NOW instead of reaching the magical number of 60 (retirement age in India). So, does it imply that we all should shun the FIRE approach? We should take expensive vacations, go to fancy restaurants, buy the latest iPhone, splurge on luxury cars, etc. (Of course, after the lockdown)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Unfortunately, the answer to this question is not so straightforward. As per the statistics, roughly about 20% of the population in India will hit the conventional retirement age of 60 by 2050. When it comes to preparedness for the same, most people rely on their children to provide them the necessary financial support. Typical investments done in retirement planning by an average Indian are in the PPF and NPS, with few looking into alternative avenues. However, rising inflation rates, coupled with declining interest rates, present a challenge for the investors. Time is running out for the young and old alike when it comes to retirement planning. The combined assets under management (AUM) of the National Pension System (NPS) and Atal Pension Yojana increased to 33.09% year-on-year (y-o-y) to touch ₹5.59 trillion as of February 2021. As of the end of February 2021, the total subscriber base was at 4.14 crore, up from 3.40 crore in February 2020 (a y-o-y increase of 21.85%). Sadly, it&rsquo;s not enough.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687949851/wpvwa2z6f5b4aqpisnxw.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 540px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Government of India&rsquo;s recent announcement to cut the interest rates on the small saving schemes should act as a premonition for reduced rates on these instruments in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687949876/qfavipusjzesm628uw2o.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 1064px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is clear that in this dynamic and challenging environment, one can achieve nirvana only by following the middle path.&nbsp; Instead of ditching the FIRE in its entirety, embrace the FI &ndash; financial independence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">FIRE may not be for everyone, but YOLO cannot be the answer for everyone! Some may perceive early retirement as freedom, but others may not. Work is not always about money but also a part of our identity and our role in society.&nbsp; But securing a financial future, having financial freedom, and physical, mental, and emotional well-being is essential for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Few key takeaways to achieve the desired Financial Independence &ndash;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Wealth is a function of our spending habits. Take control of the amount of money you spend. Remember small amounts matter &ndash;&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Latte effect. T</em>he small amount of regular discretionary expenses is burning a hole in your wallet. Analyze how much you spend in a month on that daily coffee, eating out, amazon purchases and unused subscriptions, etc. Reducing these expenses might help you contribute positively towards the environment too. This connection between wallets and environmental conservation may be a good motivation to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do not underestimate the power of compounding. Use your financial resources efficiently. Make your money work with you. The sooner you start, the less amount you have to save overall.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be financially disciplined, not necessarily frugal. Avoid owing money to your future self.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One cannot over-emphasize the importance of being financially literate, irrespective of age, gender, and occupation.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Have a well-diversified investment portfolio. Intelligent investing along with discipline is sure shot a recipe for success. Take cognizance of the changes in the risk-taking ability, tax structures, inflation, riskiness of the asset class, new emerging investment avenues.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the end, it&rsquo;s all about balancing &ndash; having a good life while preparing for a safe and secure future. Live life to the fullest &ndash; spend time with family, take care of physical and mental health. Have the financial breathing space to live life on your terms &ndash; shopping, traveling, painting, starting a business, working part-time, or doing something you enjoy. So my dear investors, &lsquo;you live only once&rsquo; may seem an attractive thought in present tumultuous times, but if you are Financially Independent, trust me, you&rsquo;ll live every day!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Taunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950029/prmuuzro0wucd6p11vzd.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"YOLO – The New Investment Mantra??","seo_keywords":"YOLO – The New Investment Mantra??","seo_description":"The mood is sombre all around us.

The surge in Covid cases has led to the health systems reach saturation level. The fear of a lockdown and its impact on business activities has been visible in the recent plummeting of the stock market.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And with the recent surge, the rebound in economy seems delayed and slow. However, like last year and always, it would be best for the investors to not panic and sell off their equity portfolios. A longer-term investment horizon is required to reach the desired returns. On the contrary, it is an excellent time to invest in equity on the days of significant fall.&nbsp;Like 2020, equities, fundamentally, will bounce back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our economy has shown signs of resilience always. We will reminisce about 2020 as the year coronavirus took over with devastating effect on human lives. Covid-19 has triggered a change in our way of life, augmented many existing trends and kick-started new ones.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This backdrop of Covid further heightens the requirement of prudent financial planning. Portfolio should be structured on the basis of risk profile, aspirations, cash flows etc of the family.&nbsp;A good financial planning helps with optimal mix of Equity, Debt, Real Estate and Alternate investments &ndash; a perfect balance of safety, liquidity and return.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The need and importance of insurance for risk management is high. Sadly, in India, insurance is still sold as a financial product rather than being bought by people to protect against uncertainties. The Economic Survey 2020-21 shows that insurance penetration (premium as a percentage of GDP) continues to be at a dismal level of 3.76 per cent in 2019, a marginal increase from 2.71 per cent in 2001. Insurance becomes a priority only when one experiences the uncertainties in life first hand, up and close, which is very common in the present times. Be it simple term insurance or medical insurance; it will be wise to safeguard aspects of health and life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A perfect hedge for an emergency, approximately equal to 12 to 24 months of expenses &ndash; should be invested in fixed income products which has high liquidity. With economy expected to recover this year, demand for goods will go up, this will lead to higher inflation and interest rates. In rising interest rate scenario, its better to stay invested in Debt funds which have maturity of upto 1-2 years. Avoid Fixed Deposit/ Bonds/ Debt Funds with a longer tenor. The amount can be reinvested at a higher rate as the interest rate goes up in next 6 months to 18 months.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It has become challenging for the investors to navigate through this bygone year, with certain tendencies creeping in the investor behaviour. It&rsquo;s essential to sanitise the portfolio based on the risk appetite and investment horizon. Equity exposure should be as per asset allocation policy. Revisit the asset allocation of portfolio and make changes as per variances. Have diversified equity exposure across International, Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Caps. Move away from the higher risk debt funds and move towards more stable debt funds with higher-rated papers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Being emotionally strong, with Covid all around us, is most important. At times, not doing anything and staying put also is an intelligent thing to do. We do not have to react to every volatility of the market at all times. Let the world and situations around us subside; investments are there to grow &ndash; sometimes at a rapid pace and at times a bit tepid. Avoid herd behaviour, bring rationality in most of the decisions taken in such scenarios. You are a different investor from others in the market. The investment horizon, return expectation, risk appetite, etc.&nbsp; is all different for each investor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So my dear investors, in the current uncertain times for the world, it is critical to maintain investment hygiene for sustenance in the long run. Clean and sanitise your portfolios, keep your distance from high-risk investments and if you are prone to herd biases, quarantine yourself from the markets on days of high volatility! When it comes to investment decisions,&nbsp; the bygone year has brought to the forefront the need for financial portfolios that can help navigate the tough times with ease.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Stay Safe &ndash; both you and your monies!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950205/vhhj5shh9zulkeqq0hch.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Pandemic Lessons – Investment Hygiene & Portfolio Sanitisation","seo_keywords":"Pandemic Lessons – Investment Hygiene & Portfolio Sanitisation","seo_description":"Being emotionally strong, with Covid all around us, is most important.

It&rsquo;s a feeling of deja-vu, and the scare of the return of taper tantrum!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To understand this, let&rsquo;s take a quick relook of 2009-2013 financial-economic scenario.&nbsp; The US Federal Reserve executed Quantitative Easing (QE) (made large purchases of bonds and other securities) in response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. This policy pumped up the liquidity in the financial sector and maintained stability to promote economic growth. The stability in the financial sector encouraged lending, consumption and investment in the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Tapering, on the contrary, means gradual reduction in the amount of money the Fed pumps into the economy. Taper Tantrum, was last witnessed in 2013, when the US Fed&rsquo;s announcement that it would taper its massive bond-buying programme that had been on since the global financial crisis led to a sudden sell-off in global stocks and bonds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950306/qxguzybro4ghremvvv3k.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1138px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This triggered capital outflows and currency depreciation in many emerging market economies that received large capital inflows. This episode earned the nickname taper tantrum. Taper because the Fed decided to taper its quantitative easing program, and tantrum because of the short-lived angry reaction of the investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The recent scare of &lsquo;taper-tantrum&rsquo; seems to have overtaken the pandemic crisis as the top most risk that is alarming the investors across the globe. The trade-off between inflation and interest rate, is a perpetual conundrum to solve for all central banks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And US Fed is no different. With the rising inflationary expectations, the US FED have may have to tighten policy sooner than planned. This expectation has triggered a widespread sell-off in government bond markets &mdash; which investors worry could get worse.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The US 10-year Treasury yield, one of the world&rsquo;s most closely watched interest rates, has risen past 1.6 per cent, up from 0.9 per cent at the beginning of the year, as investors sold the debt.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the 10-year break-even rate, a key measure of inflation expectations, now sits near its highest level since 2014.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950328/hdfgojkdoeljvxabojh8.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 657px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With this spike in US yields and rising inflationary expectations, traders have worried about a repeat of the taper tantrum of 2013. The post-Covid period was marked by massive fiscal spending and substantial monetary easing by the US and other economies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">But as expectations of a stronger economic recovery have gained ground, inflation in commodities has been rearing its head. The possibility of inflation has also fuelled concerns that the US Fed will have to reverse its quantitative easing and raise interest rates sooner rather than later. This has given rise to the possibility of a new &lsquo;tantrum&rsquo;. The chart below depicts that the emerging markets have been spooked at the very thought of the new &lsquo;tantrum&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950351/ynm3zmc2qyty0agcptw6.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 606px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India, too bears the brunt of any such policy development in the US. The last time when US Treasury yields rose sharply in 2013, it triggered an outflow of capital from emerging market economies spread over several months beginning in May 2013.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In India, foreign institutional investors pulled out money from both equities and bonds leading to rupee depreciation by over 15 per cent. This had forced the RBI to raise interest rates to prevent the capital flight.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the current times as well, with a massive government borrowing plan lined up for 2021-22, an oversupply of government bonds without a commensurate demand for them has pushed up G-sec yields. The inflationary concerns (rising crude prices) and the possibility of appropriate policy action (such as a rate hike) by the RBI are fanning the fears.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the 2013 taper tantrum, the impact on the stock market was short-lived. This time, the markets seem overvalued and investors fear that the rise in yields can become the trigger for a prolonged market correction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nonetheless, investors need not panic. It&rsquo;s important to embrace the volatility &ndash; both in equity and debt markets. Rising interest rates will benefit the short term debt instruments as the coupon will rise So, stay invested.

However, if the goalkeeper decides to stay put, there is a 33% chance he saves the goal!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As investors, we can learn from this situation at times. In times of high volatility, like the current prevailing situation, it may be prudent for the investors to just stay put. Do not stop the SIPs, do not enhance the SIPs, do not do bulk profit booking, do not switch funds. The short run volatility and the after effects of the pandemic will gradually ease out and the economy will track back on a sustainable growth path. At both equity and debt markets, the investors can take it easy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The recent capital flight from the Indian stock markets can be attributed to rising US yields. This was primary driven by rising commodity prices and fear for rising inflation.&nbsp; However, investors must stick to the current allocation across equity and debt to tide over the volatility &ndash; all asset classes have temporary blips and changing asset classes without much rational thinking can be catastrophic to the targeted return goals. At times staying put &ndash; sticking to the long run though &ndash; pays stronger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950532/d7obpbvkkesxbtsbv4hv.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 606px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is critical to stay cautious both on the equity and debt parts of the portfolio. On the equity front, stay invested for a long term &ndash; the markets seem bullish in the next few years. Book profits gradually and make entry at dips. However, excessive profit booking may also not be advisable. Where will the fresh funds be parked in the current economic scenario? An already high stock market or a debt fund at in a rising interest rate scenario or a fixed deposit earning about 5%?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The impending effect of rising inflation could be the reason that most believe. As&nbsp;growth comes back not just in India but globally, inflation is being seen to rise.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950555/yutppgkesxeflzqqmvia.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 701px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Rising yield (or falling bond prices) happens when bond investors dump existing bond holdings in expectation of high-interest rates in forthcoming bonds. For growth, the government needs funds and often resorts to borrowing from the market to meet the shortfall. Higher borrowing programme of the government is the main reason for upward movement in yields.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, if the spike in the yields continues in near future, it may be better for investors to shift funds within the debt fund category. &ldquo;Investor who require the money in the next 6 months to one year, can look to redeem from the high duration products and invest in low duration products.&rdquo; First-time investors can consider investing in mutual fund schemes in the ultra short term, Low duration and money market category.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Major sources of return for a debt fund are accrual (the interest component) and mark to market (MTM) valuations, done regularly.&nbsp; As yield level moves up, valuations are adversely impacted on an immediate basis. Overtime, accrual moves up too. A longer horizon helps in absorbing the MTM losses, allowing the interest rate cycle to take a full circle and even out the interim volatility. As per the expectations, interest rates will rise over the next year or so, short maturity debt is preferred over the long-term debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The important question here to be asked is how long investment horizon is long enough??&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no one correct answer. However, as a ballpark, investment horizon equal to the portfolio maturity is thought-out as safe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So dear investors &ndash; focus on the quality of your portfolios &ndash; both equity &amp; debt, do nothing till the volatility eases out, and stay invested for a longer tenure to reach the targeted return.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687950614/nxa722kl1rv3ka1qfqy5.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Equity & Debt Market Volatility – Stay Put to Win","seo_keywords":"Equity & Debt Market Volatility – Stay Put to Win","seo_description":"At times it is smart to stay put.

The chart below shows the journey of the Sensex over the years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687951451/kd3bbzauhfzue8m0oiwv.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 1001px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A V-shape sharp rebound is visible from the chart above. Also, the Indian economy is staging a V-shaped economic recovery. It may be seen that each sharp upturn is followed with a steep slide as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, is this euphoria sustainable? Is it completely attributed to the plush liquidity available within India and outside in the global economy? Is it truly supported by strong fundamentals of the economy? Is such high volatility the new normal? Or does this melt-up a big indication for an upcoming meltdown?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Melt up is a financial term that refers to a sharp improvement in the performance of the stock market due to reasons other than fundamental improvements in the economy. The improvement in investment performance is mainly driven by investor sentiment, where investors flock into buying stocks because they notice the market rising, and they do not want to miss out on the opportunity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Although most investors may be tempted to profit from the rising positions in the stock market, they should also understand that such movements last in the short term and the rising performance would be followed by a meltdown. Investors who let melt ups influence their decision are driven by emotions, and it is best to focus on doing due diligence to understand the actual value of an investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As &nbsp;investors, let&rsquo;s make hay while the sun shines. There is absolutely no second thoughts that the impetus announced by the government in the budget along with appropriate support from RBI will ensure a stable growth path ahead for our economy. So, we may not witness a melt-down per se, but what we may witness are few corrections coming up in the market, but that should be more of an opportunity to enter this long run rally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The long run threats &ndash; inflation, political instability, economic factors, etc may cause a blip but are more than overcome by the strong robust positive factors working for the economy. Pandemic situation seeming under control, mega economic packages from the Government (Atmanirbhar Packages &ndash; over 29 lakh crore) during 2020, the strong impetus announced in the budget with focus on growth revival, strategic support from RBI to ensure plush liquidity in the system, improving high-frequency indicators&ndash;inflation, rural growth, pick up in exports, PMI, GST and tax collections, green shoots in capex cycle &ndash; point to strong macro recovery ahead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So my dear investors, capitalize on the existing rally to book gains. Though, for a long-term perspective, it&rsquo;s better off making decisions based on market fundamentals. It is critical to analyze both qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the financial health of a company and the economy before parking the funds for a longer term. Be it short term or a longer term, it seems investors in India have a long night for party ahead!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687951536/eq2uc8yjl1miwgd5gonh.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Sensex Skyrockets – Is the Melt-Up Prelude to the Big Meltdown?","seo_keywords":"Sensex Skyrockets – Is the Melt-Up Prelude to the Big Meltdown?","seo_description":"The two major events of the week – the Union Budget FY 2021-22 and the RBI Monetary Policy – both acted as a catalyst to the already buoyant investor behaviour in the stock markets.

Sensex has moved up from 46388 to 50255 which is a growth of 7.2%. Budget has definitely created a huge euphoria in the stock market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In this article, we are not going to take you through the details of Union Budget as same has been already covered exhaustively in newspapers, media etc. However, we will tell you about important implications of budget, what are the risks, how it is going to affect various investment and what is the suggested strategy for investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Union Budget of 2021 is the first budget of the decade and the first after once-in-a-century global pandemic. It holds importance because it lays roadmap for recovery of economy after contraction of 2020.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Positive Implications:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1) Privatization of Public Sector Banks</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Government has decided to privatize two public sector banks. After 51 years of bank nationalisation, the government has finally admitted that it should not be in the business of running all public sector banks. According to us, this is going to be the single biggest reform from this budget.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On 16/1/2021,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphacapital.in/blog/warning-from-rbi-tsunami-of-bad-loans-in-2021/\">through an article</a>, we had written about the expected Tsunami of bad loans in 2021. We had talked about solution to this problem being either privatization of banks or capitalization of banks by Government.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Privatization of public sector banks is in the right direction because it will help the banks to raise money from the market on their own and it will reduce their dependence on Government for money. Also, this will decrease the financial burden on Government and will also help in credit offtake from the banks for investment in the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Intent of privatization is very good. The challenge will be in implementation of this reform. Government will see resistance from the union of bank employees and also from opposition political parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) Increase in Capital Expenditure &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Government has decided to increase capital expenditure by ~26% in comparison to last year. Government expenditures are of two types &ndash; Revenue and Capital. Revenue expenditure is for the normal running of the Government services, interest charges on debt, subsidies and so on. Capital expenditure is the part of spending that goes into the creation of assets like roads, bridges, dams, railway lines, airports etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Capital expenditure is considered to be of good quality. As per RBI study, capital expenditure has a multiplier effect of 3.25 which means that every rupee spent on capital formation induces an increase in the GDP output by Rs. 3.25.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Following chart shows historical trend of revenue and capital expenditure:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687951668/lokp5d85hn9chz9mogyp.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 364px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above chart shows that revenue expenditure will reduce from 87.3% in 2020-21 to 84.1% in 2021-22 and capital expenditure will see meaningful increase.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The decade of 2011-20 was one of the slowest for India. One of the primary reason for same is that after the great financial crisis of 2009, India decided to provide consumption stimulus to economy in the form of MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act&nbsp;), farm loan waiver etc. The trend continued for many years despite economy coming out of the woods. Because of continued higher spending on consumption, the investment for new assets creation was impacted and accordingly employment also took a hit. Also, this was one of the reason for consumption stocks doing do so well since 2009. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The budget of 2021 plans to reduce consumption expenditure towards MGNREGA by 34.5% and in PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) by 32.1%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With expected revival of capex cycle, companies connected with infrastructure and domestic manufacturing are expected to do well. &nbsp;&nbsp;Companies related to cement, steel, metals etc are hopefully going to deliver good return going forward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3) No significant change in direct and indirect taxes &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Due to Covid stress on economy, everyone was fearful that Government will increase tax in the form of Covid Cess, Wealth Tax or Inheritance Tax. &nbsp;Thankfully, Government has not made any significant changes in personal and indirect taxes. This has led to better consistency and clarity. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We have always believed that Government should reduce taxes as this will help to reduce black economy, increase tax coverage &amp; buoyancy, increase consumption and reduce migration of HNIs out of India. Government has not reduced tax but thankfully they have not increased tax.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;April 2021, Employee provident fund contribution of more than 2.5 Lacs per annum will attract tax on interest income. &nbsp;This was tax exempt till now. This has made EPY relatively less attractive. However, pre tax return of 8.5% and post tax return of ~5.7% is still better than other fixed income avenues. So investors can continue with the same. However, its suggested to revisit your asset allocation policy and plan for incremental investment in EPF &amp; Equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For ULIP Insurance policy with premium of more than 2.5 Lacs, the maturity proceeds will now become taxable. This makes Insurance for investment unattractive. Insurance is always good for risk coverage and accordingly term plan should be taken for same. Investors are suggested to avoid using Insurance for investment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Important announcements but needs to be watched:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1) Creation of Development Finance Institution (DFI)&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Government has announced creation of a Development Finance Institution (DFI) for infrastructure financing. The plan is to lend Rs 5 lakh crores over the next three years through this DFI.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the key reason for pile up of bad loans in banks is that they were made to lend to long term Infrastructure projects. There was asset liability mismatch. Banks get money through short term deposits, so they are not suitable for lending to infrastructure projects which have tenure of 10-20 years. Banks are more suitable for retail and working capital lending.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">DFI is a good solution for infrastructure financing but the problem is that in India we have tried DFI experiment in the past and have failed miserably. IDBI, IDFC, IFCI and IL&amp;FS are some of the DFIs which have failed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A big problem with DFIs is that they suffer from lending due to Crony Capitalism (Favourable lending due to advantageous relationship between business houses and government officials).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So what is special about the proposed new DFI. As per finance minister, the new DFI will be professionally managed. We are going to watch this carefully and hope that it indeed gets professionally managed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) Creation of Asset Reconstruction Company or Bad Bank:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Government has announced creation of Asset Reconstruction Company(ARC) which will be set up to take over the existing bad loans (NPAs) of PSU banks, manage them and sell them to alternate investment funds and other potential investors. The details about creation of this ARC is yet to become available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This can be a good move if new ARC can have right professionals who can focus on making high recovery from NPAs. This can also free up employees in PSU Banks to focus on better lending. Again, right implementation of ARC is they key here. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Government Borrowing Plan:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In 2020-21, the tax revenue collection has significantly fallen and to finance the expenditure, Government has increased the borrowing significantly. The fiscal deficit for 2020-21 is projected to be at 9.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is the highest fiscal deficit figure between 1970-71 and now. For 2021-22, the fiscal deficit is projected to be at 6.8%. (Higher than expected)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Fiscal Deficit as percentage of total Government expenditure</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687951692/xgnsizz38hlksyo4chng.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 648px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above charts shows that out of total money spent by Government, ~54% will be borrowed money for 2020-21 and ~43% for 2021-21. Long term average is around 35%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Supply of the bonds in the market for borrowing by Government:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687951711/ixgcrxqp2abaphmrqxhx.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 523px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above chart clearly shows huge increase in borrowing by Government through bonds since 2020. Ideally, this should have led to increase in interest rates. But this has not happened due to support from RBI in the form of loose monetary policy and printing of money to buy Government Bonds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Movement of Interest rates in future will depend on support from RBI. As economy recovers, RBI will be gradually winding up the monetary support which it had given in 2020 due to Covid crisis. However, we feel that RBI will continue to support Government borrowing program and most probably will ensure that there are no sudden spikes in interest rates. High Interest rates will increase interest cost for Government and will further lead to higher fiscal deficit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We will get more visibility about RBI support in the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting which is scheduled to be held on 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;February 2021.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&nbsp;We need to be careful about following Risks:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fiscal deficit reduction plan proposed by Government is stretched. Government is planning to bring fiscal deficit down to 4.5% by 2026. This means that Government plans to run high borrowing plan for a long time. &nbsp;This will lead to high Debt/GDP ratio.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To support high borrowing plan, RBI will have to run loose monetary policy and print money to buy bonds for long. This is definitely going to be inflationary. &nbsp;If inflation &amp; interest rates goes up and growth does not oblige, then we are going to fall in a big debt trap. Hopefully, good GDP growth will come if plan is executed well.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We will need global support in the form of low interest rates, FDI inflow and FII inflows for smooth execution of the plan. Any external shock like taper tantrum of 2013 can create problems.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Impact on Equity and Debt:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to us, the budget is a good plan on paper which has been made with good intentions. The key to success is smooth execution of the plan. If the plan is implemented properly and without delay then we can see a good boost to the GDP growth of India and significant increase in corporate earnings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Equity:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Equity markets should do well if the execution happens as per plan. Revival of capex should lead to cyclical sectors doing well. Companies connected with infrastructure and domestic manufacturing are expected to do well. Banking and PSU stocks have recently gone up with expectation of privatization and credit offtake.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Equity Funds which use value strategy and invests in cyclical sectors should hopefully start performing now.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A big challenge for equity market is high valuation.

Covid-19 and the consequent lockdown had a devastating effect on economy. &nbsp;The GDP declined by 23.9% in Q2 of 2020. Thankfully, Indian economy has been seeing a good and better than expected recovery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One unsolved puzzle has been that despite lockdown, negative growth in GDP and businesses being hit significantly, we have not seen loan defaults and banking crisis.

They were as under:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">RBI allowed restructuring of loans for everyone by offering moratorium (Postponement of payment)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Supreme Court on 3/9/20, directed the banks that loan accounts which hadn&rsquo;t been declared as a bad loan shall not be declared as one, until further orders.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to above developments, recognition of bad loans by banks was postponed and the banking crisis was avoided. However, this was only postponed to future and someday it was supposed to come back to hound us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The time of reckoning came sooner than expected when recently (January 11, 2021), RBI released Financial Stability Report (FSR). The FSR report is an important and exhaustive report on health of economy and financial sector.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The key takeaways from report are as under:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Gross bad loans on bank balance sheets could rise to 13.5% by 30th Sept, 2021 as compared to 7.5% in September 2019.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the worst case scenario, the gross bad loans could rise to 14.8%&mdash;Almost double the size of the current bad loans.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In absolute numbers, total bad loans as of March, 2020 stood at ~Rs. 9 Lac Crores.&nbsp;<strong>It is expected that bad loans will double to ~Rs. 18 Lacs Crores by September, 2021.</strong></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>​​​​​​​</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">At aggregate level, banking sector will be able to handle the stress.

Would also like to highlight that in the past, RBI has been conservative in predicting the bad loans. Actual number of bad loans have been higher in most of the times.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>So what does this means to investor. According to us, following are the implications for investors:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><u>1) GDP Growth</u>&nbsp;&ndash;</span>&nbsp;</strong>Because of huge bad loans, the banking losses will increase. Banks will have to do provisioning for these losses from their capital. This will lead to reduced equity capital and will hence reduce the credit off take (Giving of loan) by banks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to weak balance sheet of banks, the banks will not be in a situation to give loans to corporates for new projects. This will slow down the investment in economy and will lead to slow down in GDP growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Similar situation has been playing out for India since 2014. Due to significant bad loans, banks have slowed down in giving out loans to corporates for investment and this has been one of the primary reason for slow GDP growth in last 7 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The solution to this problem is that either Government should capitalize the PSU banks or privatize the PSU banks. Both of them are not happening as Government doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to capitalize the PSU banks and they don&rsquo;t want to privatize the banks because they run various social loan programs through PSU banks and also because it&rsquo;s a political issue to privatize the banks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Overall, bad loans will impact GDP growth in years to come for India. Investors should keep this in mind when setting up expectations of return from Equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong><u>2) Fixed Income/ Debt</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash;</span> Since bad loans are expected to go up, we may see defaults from corporates, NBFCs and even banks. So investors have to be very careful about their debt portfolio. Next few years, investors should not chase higher return on debt portfolio and should only focus on high quality. Investors should contend themselves with lower returns from fixed income investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">At Alpha Capital, we believe that for debt portfolio, investors should not touch any fixed income product which is yielding 1% more than your bank FD return. Of course, there can be exceptions when risk return reward is in favour of the investor. Our experience, has been that&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;There is no free lunch&rsquo;</strong>. If someone is offering even 0.1% extra return on debt then it comes with some additional risk. Its important for investors to understand and analyse the products carefully.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Accordingly, following is suggested for various fixed income products:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>a) Debt Mutual Funds &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Its suggested that we stay invested in only those debt mutual funds which have very high quality portfolio. We did a lot of restructuring for all clients between March and May of 2020 within debt portfolio to ensure that we exit all funds with risky papers. As of now, we are in very good situation and we have ensured that our debt portfolio is safe and very high in quality. Going forward, we are going to further closely monitor this space because sometimes even very high quality papers become junk (Example &ndash; IL&amp;FS, DHFL, Yes Bank etc).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>b) Bank Fixed Deposits &amp; Bank Balances &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>These are mostly safe but Latin phrase&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Caveat emptor&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;which means&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Let the buyer beware&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;is more valid here. 10 years back, the perception was that anything which is backed by Government is safe and that Government will always protect investors. But now the narrative is changing. Government is now asking investors to read the documents carefully.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the case of Yes Bank AT1 Perpetual Bonds, Rs. 8415 Crores of bonds became Zero for investors when Yes Bank went into restructuring. When this was challenged in Chennai High Court, then the RBI in its affidavit categorically stated that AT1 Bonds had the feature of its value becoming Zero in case of trouble in the Bank and the same was communicated to the investors. Hence, the bank was not liable to pay the investors for any kind of loss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per RBI, bank fixed deposits and bank balance is protected by insurance of upto Rs. 5 Lacs. Anything beyond this is at risk. Now this amount will only come at risk when the underlying bank comes under stress and defaults. Government in the past has communicated that it will protect bank depositors. But keeping &lsquo;Caveat emptor&rsquo; in mind, it is suggested that investors should stay away from banks which are under stress or are expected to come under stress in future. These banks normally offer higher return on bank balance and fixed deposits. Its fine to earn low return for few years and stay invested in only high quality banks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>c)&nbsp;</strong><strong>NCD, NLD, Perpetual Bonds</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Because of low interest rates in deposits and other fixed income investment, instruments like Non Convertible Debentures (NCD), Nifty Linked Debentures (NLD), AT1 Perpetual bonds are becoming available with relatively better return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors are required to review them with magnifying glasses and understand the default risk carefully. Issuer of underlying paper and terms of the product should be carefully examined to understand the risk. Stay away from them if something doesn&rsquo;t feel right as there is no point in taking unwanted risk for extra return. It is better to take higher risk in equity where return payoff is proportional and higher.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">3) Equity&nbsp;&ndash;</span>&nbsp;</strong>As explained above, bad loans will have an impact on GDP Growth of India. This should fundamentally affect corporate earnings and equity returns. Will this lead to equity correction or fall? We don&rsquo;t know. Its very difficult to predict the movement of equity in short term as equity market also gets influenced by liquidity and sentiment. If global liquidity continues for long, &nbsp;market can also keep going up accordingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Always remember &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Markets can be irrational for a very long time&rsquo;</strong>. Investors should definitely be careful and watch the investment closely. Book profit with upward movement of market and buy when markets are correcting. We feel volatility will be high in 2021 and will give good opportunity to investors to take advantage and generate better returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Are banking stocks going to be affected?&nbsp;</strong>Bank stocks have already been hit in the last 1 year, which can be seen as under:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687952749/g1ir3pzxgsweulvnzc1r.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 654px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>*Source : Ngen</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per the above chart, Nifty in the last 1 year has given a return of ~18.5% and during the same period, banking Index has given a return ~0%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Its very difficult to say whether the worst is over for bank stocks. Could be possible that they fall further from here or even start recovering from here after the under-performance of last 1 year. Our suggestion will be that we should let the equity fund managers take this call based on their analysis and outlook.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2021 is definitely going to be an interesting year. Markets are expected to be volatile. We are excited and ready to handle any crisis.

Landmark because of a million reasons &ndash; which are usually witness only in a lifetime. And it paves way for a new hope for the upcoming 2021.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">And like every year, new beginnings are marked by celebrations, fanfare and fervour with friends and family. An unmissable part of every new year are the new year resolutions that we all make.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, my dear readers, this new year 2021, with the experience of what we saw in the last 10 months &ndash; I urge you all to make a promise to yourselves to be more financially responsible. Business/ Job stability is important; however, financial stability is more crucial. Consumption is a necessity, however, only after adequate savings and appropriate investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, if you haven&rsquo;t started thinking on these lines yet, there is no better time than new year to safeguard your future financially. The keyword is INVEST. As they say &ndash;<strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago and the second-best time is now.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For the first time investors &ndash;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>to start is important</strong></span>&nbsp;&ndash; add a few financial products like mutual funds, provident fund,&nbsp; gold bonds etc in your basket. &nbsp;The right thing is to begin investing right away, regardless of how much money you save. These small investments balloon into a large corpus over time due to compounding. Optimal mix of traditional and unconventional mix of financial products are out there to be explored and benefitted from.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">While investing money in various financial products is important.<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">&nbsp;<strong>What is more important is to be financially literate.</strong></span>&nbsp;Financial literacy is our ability to understand how to use money as a tool to help us craft successful lives by the standards that matter to us &ndash; Distinguishing between needs and wants; Making smart money choices; Setting and saving for goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Being financially independent is of paramount importance to everyone. Working professionals ought to spend time understanding their salary structures; everyone (including women) should manage their finances on their own,&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>make mistakes and learn from them for the future, and save enough to have a buffer to meet contingencies</strong></span>.&nbsp;Having this knowledge supports our ability to make prudent financial decisions throughout life and to respond competently and confidently to the inevitable financial uncertainties that we all face.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A big shout to the parents, who must have showered gift on their kids on Christmas/ New Year. The moment we assume the role of a parent, building a financially secure future assumes top priority, impacting the way we view, spend, save and invest our finances. You can (and should) make sure that you have enough to give your kids a good start in life. But remember it is just a start.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is important for parents to realize that the struggle to secure the child&rsquo;s future is pointless if the child is not taught how to manage these finances.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Teaching children how to manage money is one of the most important responsibilities parents have</strong></span>.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never too early to begin teaching children the basics of finances &ndash; How money works. What are earnings, savings and investments, What happens when you buy something? What exactly does a bank do with your money? How do taxes work? What are investments? How do investments grow? How is money created? Why does the value of investments increase with time while that of a car or a phone decrease? Why were prices of things low in the past? Why will they be higher in the future? Etc&hellip;..</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, start grooming your child today. This knowledge is more useful than money is &ndash; and it could also be something that is passed from generation to generation long after you and I are gone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you have been on your investment journey for long, it is likely that you have enough corpus with you and if it is invested wisely, it would have grown in value with time. It is always comforting to have the financial flexibility with time and options on your side.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Money allows people to live longer and healthier lives, better nutrition and better medical care, more free time and more meaningful labor&mdash;more of just about every ingredient in the recipe for a happy life. Yet, the relationship between money and happiness (quality of life) is not that simple.&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">The key to happiness is in the way we spend it</span>&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; basically using the acquired wealth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The focus of saving money should be to enhance your wealth without compromising on your personal freedom while creating financial security. Though it is common sense and sounds easy but more often than not it is difficult to follow.&nbsp; Mindless saving trades off the present for the future. It is important to know the difference between hoarding and saving. Hoarding can be understood as an exaggeration of an otherwise positive behaviour&mdash; saving&mdash;taken to the extreme.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some people hoard money, while others compulsively hoard objects of their interest&mdash;jewellery, gold bars and coins, unaccounted cash, etc. Over saving may not be as serious as going into heavy consumer debt. However, going to the either extreme is not healthy. No one can deny that savings is a hedge against life&rsquo;s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. Everyone knows the tangible stuff money buys. But the desire for more stuff is never satisfied and we are left chasing goal posts that are constantly moving.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As Greek philosopher Epictetus said, &ldquo;wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.</span>&nbsp;</strong>And to do that, you have to stop comparing yourself to others, and start determining what is &ldquo;enough&rdquo; for yourself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One needs to develop the ability to balance the present and future needs, and apportion money accordingly. The most beautiful things in life are not things. They&rsquo;re people, and places, and memories, and pictures. They&rsquo;re feelings and moments and smiles and laughter. Spending need not result in material things&mdash;there are wonderful experiences the world has to offer if you choose to step out and explore. So, invest in yourself &ndash; take a course in photography, wildlife, art, theatre or in upskilling yourself from a professional perspective.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you recognise that you have enough and some more money, learn to give.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Beyond a point it is the act of giving that money that brings joy.</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy New Year!!

A discussion on Buffet&rsquo;s Alpha highlights the Buffett&rsquo;s returns appear to be neither luck nor magic but, rather, a reward for leveraging cheap, safe, high-quality stocks over a long (very long) period of staying invested.&nbsp;<strong>Beta anomaly is regarded as one of the most puzzling phenomena in the history of finance as it negates the fundamental notion that a higher return can only be earned after taking more risk.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Betting against Beta or Low volatility is simply a way of buying stocks which rank low on standard deviation or volatility over a look back period of 6-12 months. Stocks that would rank high on this factor would be stocks where most investors under-react to information being fed to them on a regular basis, owing to the certainty bias. When an outcome is likely, people tend to underestimate its odds. This bias has been named the certainty effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per financial theory, we would expect over a long period, high beta stocks should have done much better than low volatility and low beta stocks. However, when we see the returns of Nifty Low Volatility 50 Index (The least volatile security in the index gets the highest weight) and Nifty High Beta 50 Index (The security with the highest beta in the index is assigned the highest weight), the reverse holds true. Research studies also offer evidence in support of the existence of beta-anomaly (long leveraged low-beta assets and short high-beta assets) in the Indian equity market also.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687953616/cz6yjahumfbcns8y5opl.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 508px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The study titled &ldquo;A Lottery-Demand-Based Explanation of the Beta Anomaly,&rdquo; which appears in the December 2017 issue of the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis explains: &ldquo;Lottery investors generate demand for stocks with high probabilities of large short-term up moves in the stock price. Such up moves are partially generated by a stock&rsquo;s sensitivity to the overall market&mdash;market beta. A disproportionately high (low) amount of lottery demand-based price pressure is therefore exerted on high-beta (low-beta) stocks, pushing the prices of such stocks up (down) and therefore decreasing (increasing) future returns.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, what does this really mean for us investors?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To formulate a strategy in the context, think of a barbell approach of investing. As per the barbell strategy, the optimal way is to strike a balance between reward and risk while investing. That is, to invest in the two extremes of high risk and no risk assets while avoiding middle-of-the-road choices. Some sectors are available at extremely discounted valuations &ndash; banking sector, consumer discretionary, energy and industrials, led by government spending and domestic consumption, a combination of both. Profit booking in safety/ comfort sectors like FMCG. One has to have defensive stocks to beat the volatility, but as you move to a full-blown recovery globally and in India, you need to be shifting towards cyclicals and the banking sector. The PSUs have been unloved for a long time and the valuations are compelling.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Strategizing &amp; Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687953695/irj4oinp4xgwmfaxji26.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Betting For or Against the Beta – Which Side are You?","seo_keywords":"Betting For or Against the Beta – Which Side are You?","seo_description":"Financial theory tells us that to earn return, one needs to take risk.

Since Bitcoin reduces the power of Countries to print money at their own will, no Government would like Bitcoin to be popular. So most probably Governments are going to ban or try reducing the public usage of Bitcoin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">b) Bitcoin can be used for money laundering and terrorist financing due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">c) Bitcoin is highly volatile and investors should be comfortable to see a loss of 95% in a very short period of time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">d) Bitcoin is prone to hacking and scams. Its not easy investing and storing the bitcoin. Since its digitally stored, its always exposed to digital frauds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>8) What should be the portfolio strategy for Bitcoin? Does it makes sense to invest?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">If investor is comfortable with the above mentioned risks then he/ she can consider investing in the Bitcoin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Only that money should be invested in Bitcoin, which investor is comfortable to lose completely and which he/ she can forget for 10-20 years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">From an Asset Allocation perspective, an allocation of upto 0.5%-1% of total investible surplus can be considered in Bitcoin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The advantage of having Bitcoin in portfolio is that it can deliver asymmetric returns for overall portfolio. In 10-20 years, Bitcoin will either become Zero or can become 10 to 100 times. For an investor who is investing 0.5%- 1% of his/ her wealth, the loss will not be significant if value becomes zero but if the value goes up by 10 to 100 times then return contribution in portfolio can be huge and very meaningful.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">In case you decide to take the plunge in Bitcoin then it will be ideal to build exposure gradually in phases since there has been a huge rally recently. This will help in reducing the market timing risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">The most important recommendation for investors considering to invest in Bitcoin is that they should spend good amount of time reading about Bitcoin and understanding the fine points in detail. Knowledge and conviction of Bitcoin will help them in handling the volatility well and take right decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\">Dr. Mukesh Jindal CFA, CFP, CAIA.

The GDP numbers across the world have plummeted to levels never seen before. The second quarter numbers for FY 2020-21 have been released for India.

From the nadir of negative 23.9% GDP growth in the previous quarter, the economy rebounded to negative 7.5% in the July-September period. The growth numbers beat the estimates of most economists &ndash; across the three components as well. Manufacturing depicted 0.6 per cent growth in July-September after it had shrunk by a massive 39 per cent in the preceding quarter. Continuing its strong resistance, the agriculture sector grew by 3.4 per cent, while the trade and services sector showed lower-than-expected contraction at 15.6 per cent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Though the recovery has been sharp, for Q2, India&rsquo;s among the worst-performing major advanced and emerging economies. It seems India is in for a tough fight as it attempts to curtail rising covid cases, revive consumption demand, boost investment and create jobs. As per the data, only&nbsp;China&nbsp;seemed to have a positive growth rate with 4.9 in the July-September quarter of FY2021. The GDP of&nbsp;US&nbsp;stands at (-)2.9 percent, while for&nbsp;France its (-)3.9 percent. Despite making a recovery,&nbsp;UK and&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;saw a contraction of (-)9.6 and (-)4 percent respectively. While&nbsp;South Korea, Russia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Japan, the GDP contracted by 1.3, 3.6 and 5.8 percent, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687955665/blyr7jb4okrhpkf0h5cu.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 411px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This dichotomy in the interpretation of the GDP numbers can be extended to the stock markets. On one hand, the current surge in the stock markets may seems unsustainable &ndash; may lead to volatility in the next few weeks, however it seems certainly sustainable over the long run. Most of the stocks, both in the mid-cap and small-cap, space have revived to pre-covid levels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With economic reforms planned out, it seems the long run rise has just begun. As the vaccine development news pick up gradually, the green shoots for the economy will be more visible. This would create a robust path ahead for our stock markets. India will continue to be prominent player in the global economy, even as the covid concerns recede. Backed with improved domestic fundamentals and confidence of foreign capital, the stock markets are expected to see new highs in the next fiscal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Look for opportunities in these temporary volatile times. The global investor is bullish on India in the long run. Let&rsquo;s look for the entry points at every sharp fall, book profits in portfolios that didn&rsquo;t work well even in the pre-covid times and stay invested through SIP/STP formats for the longer run.

However, its important that we consider this in respect to attractiveness of other asset classes. Interest rate in India has fallen by approx. 2.3% in last 2 years and has made fixed income less attractive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Globally, ~26% of investment grade bonds are trading below zero interest rate which is leading to inflow into equity markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to us, Indian Equity market is in fair value &amp; comfortable zone now considering the low interest rates in India and globally.

The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s low-interest policy is expected to continue, especially in the near-term. This will boost the capital flight to emerging markets specially India, China, Indonesia etc. in search for higher returns. This is a big plus for Indian markets as it would result in the continued inflow of cheap capital into Indian stock as well as debt markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687957587/jateggmqzxzeedbqxcob.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 563px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As seen in the above chart of US Dow Jones and Sensex, the historical pattern suggests that both share a high degree of positive co-relation. Both Trump and Biden have promised bigger stimulus, irrespective of who wins, the announcement of it will lead to a boost in the US stock markets. Since both the indices are positively correlated, Indian markets too shall remain on an upward trend supported by global sentiments. Hence, in the medium to long run, there are prospects of money flowing into the Indian Capital markets post-election.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Further, the election cacophony closer to home is equally music to the ears (pun intended!).

The table below depicts the returns on BSE Sensex values, 6 months before the Lok Sabha elections and 18 months post the Lok Sabha elections. The returns have been happily positive in almost all cases.

Artisans, who mostly reside in rural areas, see significant growth in their sales with greater employment as a cascading effect, owing to increased emphasis on sustainable consumption. The economic importance of the festive season lies in the fact that consumers tend to spend more during this period, with several upgrading their products.

The current season is likely to be bumper for the e-retailers much more than the traditional stores.

This tendency of financial assets returns, inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behaviour is popularly known as the calendar anomaly or the seasonality effect.

Globally, most common calendar anomaly is the January effect, which illustrates higher expected returns in the month of January than the rest of the year.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687957960/lyx8ykyh3edfbdbetxs2.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 608px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This outcome of Diwali in India is a corollary of the Christmas effect in USA or the Ramdan effect in Middle East countries or the Spring Festival effect in China or &lsquo;Dekansho-bushi&rsquo; effect in Japan which illustrates higher expected returns during these festivals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Understanding of the reasons behind this seasonality or anomaly offer the investors the chances to earn extraordinary returns.&nbsp;<em>Misattribution bias</em>&nbsp;provides support to this argument<strong><em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;It refers to the tendency of a decision maker to misattribute her/his mood to the financial decision making.

I would rather say a much-needed elixir for all the cricket lovers amidst the pandemic and the dwindling economic scenario. The players are auctioned and the most preferred player takes home a hefty booty. But does winning the most sought-after player generate the expected performance on the field? Yes may not be the correct answer every time. Pat Cummins, the most expensive and sought-after player in the current season of the IPL was hit for 49 runs off his 18 balls recently. So, readers, does the auction winner actually win?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is popularly known as the phenomenon of Winner&rsquo;s Curse. The bidder who wins an auction typically pays more than the asset is actually worth as repeated bidding results in overpaying for the asset, way more than the intrinsic value or true worth of an item. Regrettably, the winner&rsquo;s curse is typically most often realised after the fact. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Without going into details of the concept of economic game theory, the winner seems to be &lsquo;cursed&rsquo;, owing to incomplete information and bidder&rsquo;s emotions. At its core, the winner&rsquo;s curse is a combination of cognitive and emotional friction. The buyer is victorious in owning whatever asset they are&nbsp;bidding on. However, the asset is likely worth far less in resale value after ownership due to different factors affecting the purchase and influencing its value in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687958618/ccqbgiprfr5lccdyhk6u.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 618px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The asset may be an IPL player, a piece of art, real estate, jewellery or a stock! The stock market is also one big auction, where one bids and the highest bidder wins and is the owner of that financial asset.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Pricing of IPOs is often marred by the winner&rsquo;s curse phenomenon. Companies want to sell their shares at maximum price. No wonder, IPOs come when stock market is in bull phase and when sentiment of investors are running high.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The recent changes by SEBI in the allocation of multi-cap mutual funds will push up the prices for many mid-cap and small-cap stocks. Everyone has commenced re-adjusting their portfolios to cherry-pick the most coveted mid &amp; small-cap scrips. But is the overreaction leading to the price hike justified in the intrinsic values of these companies?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is often argued that investors become excessively optimistic (pessimistic) about future news announcements after a series of good (bad) news and send stock prices to unjustifiable high (low) levels. Once subsequent news becomes known, it is likely to contradict this optimism (pessimism) leading to the correction of mispricing in the long-run.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As prudent investors, it is imperative to evaluate your BATNA &ndash; Best Alternative To A Negotiated Agreement. If your best alternative to winning the auction is to not win the auction, then tailor your bidding accordingly to head off the &ldquo;need to succeed&rdquo; at all costs. Thus, emotions, irrationalities, rumours, and other subjective factors can push prices far beyond their true values. To avoid becoming the next victim of the winner&rsquo;s curse, follow these three principles:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Knowing the true value or the fair price of the asset you are bidding for is quite crucial before you even go for it. Appropriate research and analysis should be done to be clear in the mind, not get swayed and stick to the decisions made</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Demarcate between your emotional mind and the rational mind. As soon as you start placing your first bid, you should know where to draw the line. This would help you hold your grounds more firmly.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Be sure of how important it is for you to win. Rational arguments are always better when you are in a confused state of mind.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So dear investors, let&rsquo;s stay away from &lsquo;winner&rsquo;s curse&rsquo; and be rational winners that are blessed with the alphas in their returns!&nbsp;<img alt=\"????\" draggable=\"false\" role=\"img\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f642.svg\" style=\"height: 15px; width: 15px;\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687958745/bikwpcfuuwb1wra2zddr.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Who Won? – I Did.

But, it seems the financial world we live in is no less than one in the current times! The Covid-19 catastrophe has led to an unprecedented fall in the GDP growth numbers for India. We may consider the break-out of this devastating pandemic a black swan event. But the consequences that we are facing and may continue to face on the macroeconomic front are the jarring pink flamingos following the atrocious black swan (pun intended)!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687959344/nn7qwoogmep9elacwojo.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 788px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Black Swan, a popular term in the financial jargon, refers to a highly improbable event with a major impact. On the other hand, Pink Flamingos refer to a predictable event that is ignored due to cognitive biases of a senior leader or a group of leaders trapped by powerful institutional forces. So, if the pandemic break-out is the black swan, the &lsquo;obvious&rsquo; macro-economic spill-overs are the pink flamingos. As an investor, we must learn to deal with both while on this financial safari. The plummeting of the GDP growth rate, increasing upward pressure on the inflation, RBI&rsquo;s monetary policy actions, corporates slow pace of reviving the production, and more are all the contagion effect of the pandemic. We must not be surprised by these pink flamingos rather be prepared for these macroeconomic shocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Black Swan event usually sits at the tail of the financial curve. If we plot out that chart, the &lsquo;tail risk&rsquo; appears on either side of the mean. Tails refer to the end portions of the distribution curves, showing the probabilities of variety of outcomes. The tail risk represents the chance that a dramatic, unexpected event can cause a significant swing in value. These &lsquo;black swan&rsquo; events are rare, but very important. However, what takes the centre stage are the tails, and most of us investors are rather worried about the left tails only. We must sharpen our focus on not what tail risk is but what it means for the investment decisions. It is both critical and smart to not ignore these highly impactful and highly improbable events!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Making investment decisions based on the expected outcome as measured by the averages can lead to huge portfolio losses. One can often make money in trades that have horrible remote loss scenarios but excellent expected returns. Extreme outcomes with low probability should be given importance in such situations. This is an important learning from such &lsquo;black swan&rsquo; events. As nonagenarian Warren Buffett mentions &ndash;&nbsp;<em><strong>&lsquo;Many people don&rsquo;t think deeply enough about the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;of&nbsp;remote loss scenarios. Instead, they only focus on&nbsp;weighted average expected returns&nbsp;which look so good because the&nbsp;weights&nbsp;of the remote loss scenario are so&nbsp;small&nbsp;in the expected value table.&rsquo;</strong></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The black swan is an occurrence where nothing in the past could convincingly suggest it could have happened and its impact is massive. Economies have stalled, markets have plunged and there is widespread panic across asset classes. The macroeconomic tail risk i.e. the left tail of the distribution is positively correlated with slack in financial conditions. Financial conditions create downside risk to the economy. And when the distribution is not normal, all the analysis based on this assumption of normality fails.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687959366/j2m8ddy8y65j3se016jr.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 672px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Left tail events have had a devastating impact on portfolio returns, impeding investors&rsquo; potential to achieve their financial objectives. How well we manage these unlikely outcomes largely defines us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687959390/lg1bwxuyxw89dhw5vitw.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 635px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As an investor, we must be aware about the tail risk, and not be influenced by averages and standard deviation but focus on what appears to be realistically possible. We must identify our degree of risk tolerance &ndash; whether your portfolio has the capacity to bear losses up to and including the left tail or not. If you have that risk appetite then stay invested for the long term. It is often difficult to find refuge or seek protection in any asset class in the financial upheaval but while you do security selection &ndash; look for extreme volatility/ values in the returns, and the frequency of its occurrence, i.e. how fat the tail is and with that awareness make the investment decision. Another alternative is to identify sectors which are antifragile. In simpler terms, the sectors that gain in this VUCA (&ldquo;Volatile,&rdquo; &ldquo;Uncertain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ambiguous.&rdquo;) world. These sectors &ndash; the known knowns are our pink flamingos as well in the current scenario. In contrast to the downside beta, one can look at tail beta, which measures co-movement with the market if the downturns are extreme.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, readers, let&rsquo;s not get swayed by the black swan event we are in. These tail risk events should be hedged appropriately and treated as an opportunity to make higher returns. Besides, it&rsquo;s more critical to keep our eyes open to the pink flamingos that shall follow.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here&rsquo;s wishing us all abundant luck to survive the Indian Economic Jungle!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687959461/fzusfam8xbdpm0rqjudy.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Indian Economic Jungle – Pink Flamingos following the Black Swan!","seo_keywords":"The Indian Economic Jungle – Pink Flamingos following the Black Swan!","seo_description":"Readers we are not planning to take you through a virtual jungle safari.

India being no different. The GDP growth is expected to slip in the negative for the FY 2020-21, first time in the history of independent India, squashing our dream to be a $5 trillion economy by 2023.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">To revive economic growth, there are two major policy tools &ndash; the fiscal policy and the monetary policy. Readers, lets take you through some basics of macroeconomics for you to better appreciate the dilemma of our policy makers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The economic policy puzzle is best solved by having an optimal mix of the monetary policy and the fiscal policy. RBI spears ahead the monetary policy while the Government takes care of the action at the fiscal policy front.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The amalgamation of the two policy framework can be explained from the IS-LM framework (popularly know as Hicks-Hansen model). The IS-LM framework is the key for the economy to tide over the current growth-inflation stand-off. Both the IS and LM curve are drawn on the interest rate &ndash; output space.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688015696/emykxwnp0ivxrvl1mmca.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 698px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The IS curve is the Investment Savings Curve for the economy representing the goods market that gets moved when the fiscal policy changes. An expansionary fiscal policy shifts the curve outward while a contractionary fiscal policy shifts the curve inwards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Similarly, the LM curve or the Liquidity &amp; Money Supply curve (representing in the money market) is the tool with the RBI to move the output and interest levels of the economy. An expansionary monetary policy such as reduction in interest rates shifts the LM curve to the right while a contractionary moneraty policy shifts the LM curve to the left.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Coming back to the current situation being faced by India. Already, prior to the pandemic, not all was hunky-dory with the economy. The economic growth was slipping and RBI had initiated gradual reduction in the key policy rates to revive growth. Since February 2019, the repo rate had been gradually reduced from 6.25% to 5.15% in October 2019. And then further from 5.15% to 4% post the advent of the pandemic. However, is it really translating into the economic growth revival? Only time will tell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688015730/ldaisukljuejxmjlotmk.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 712px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Though RBI has managed to pump in liquidity in the system through its various measures, in the current economic scenario this may be necessary but not a sufficient action to revive growth keeping the inflation within the tolerable limits. An optimal stitching of the fiscal policy along with the monetary policy is what is required at this juncture.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Continuous reduction in interest rate is not desirable &ndash; this will lead to a surge in inflation if the economic production does keep pace, leading us into the vicious circle of stagflation. Since the monetary policy measures start showing results in the economy with a lag of a few quarters, it is prudent to hold on the rate cuts, let the decisions seep in the economic system, and let the fiscal policy measures be used to boost government spending and increase investment and consumption demand for the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So readers, it is time to trust our experienced policy makers to make the right changes in the macroeconomic variables that would overhaul the entire cycle and bring India back on the desired growth trajectory.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Taunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688015828/mm4u40jlywidmlwcff8u.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"RBI’s Conundrum: Growth vs Inflation","seo_keywords":"RBI’s Conundrum: Growth vs Inflation","seo_description":"Covid-19 has adversely impacted the entire world with most economies and industries are under severe stress.

The biggest question running in the mind of investors right now is whether equity exposure should be reduced. In this article, we try to figure out the answer to this question by using the indicator PB Ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Price to Book (PB) Ratio helps in understanding how many times the stock is trading over and above the company&rsquo;s book value. The PB Ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price of stock with book value per share of the company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">PB Ratio is a good indicator for valuation of a company or the broad equity market. If PB Ratio is trading at a value higher than long term average of the ratio then asset is overvalued. Similarly, a value below long term average is a sign of undervaluation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In the current Covid times, the valuation indicator PB Ratio has become more meaningful especially because PE (Price to Earnings) Ratio has become irrelevant. The corporate earnings have fallen because of Covid and lockdown. This correction in earnings is short term and not structural. The earnings will again bounce back after 2-3 quarters. Since earnings have fallen, the PE Ratio has automatically gone up and is giving a false indication of overvaluation. Its better not to use PE Ratio till the time earnings normalize.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Here, we have tried to analyse the valuation of equity market on the basis of PB Ratio and the implications of same on future expected return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Current and long term average of PB Ratio for Nifty 50 &amp; NSE 500:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688016155/bd8wmslzde2e3utx5svt.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 396px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above table shows that current PB Ratio of Nifty is 3.21 and median PB Ratio is 3.4 (Median is favoured over average as it reduces the impact of outliers). Since current PB Ratio is below long term median, it can be said that Nifty is undervalued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Similarly, for NSE 500 which is a broader and preferred index, the current PB Ratio is 3.05 and median PB Ratio is 3.04. This shows that broader equity market is fairly valued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Scatter Plot of NSE 500 and 5 Years Return</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688016179/itcb8kthi1f2ml1ntmqn.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 559px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above scatter plot shows the relationship between PB Ratio and investment return after 5 Years. The above chart shows that correlation between PB Ratio and 5 years return is high and both of them are inversely proportional. When PB Ratio is high then future 5 years return is low and vice versa.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Statistically, R Square (R2) which measures the strength of relationship between two variables is at 70% for the above model. In simple language, PB Ratio can predict next 5 years of return with 70% accuracy. This is meaningful and relevant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above scatter plot also shows that at current PB Ratio of 3, the future expected return for next 5 years is ~9% per annum and minimum expected return is ~4% per annum. This is a prediction with 70% accuracy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Range of Return at different PB Ratios:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688016210/hzeaw3eq4m1iryladzfc.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 194px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above table shows average, maximum and minimum 5 years return at different PB Ratios. The average 5 years return in equity is 11%. The return increases when investment is made at low PB Ratio and reduces when investment is made in high PB Ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Investment Implications:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The key investment implications from above study are as under:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">1) Currently, equity market is fairly valued. The market has run up since correction in March, 2020. But despite the rally, equity market is not in overvalued zone. Its not the time to reduce equity exposure but to stay invested in Equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2) Exposure in equity should be changed based on PB Ratio valuation. Future 5 years expected return is inversely proportional to PB Ratio. Accordingly, exposure should be increased in equity at low PB Ratio and decreased at high PB Ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">3) Since, current PB Ratio of NSE 500 is close to long term average, investors are recommended to stick to their policy Asset Allocation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Neeru Seal &amp; Dr. Mukesh Jindal</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688016322/butr0idmm2sqtwhhzixy.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Equity Market & PB Ratio – Valuation and Performance Analysis","seo_keywords":"Equity Market & PB Ratio – Valuation and Performance Analysis","seo_description":"In the current Covid times, the valuation indicator PB Ratio has become more meaningful especially because PE (Price to Earnings) Ratio has become irrelevant.

Look at all the progress our economy has made since then. In May 2020, who would have imagined that Sensex would cross the iconic 50000 mark by 2022 and who be nearing the 60000 mark by 2025. Its over 100% jump in the Sensex from the nadir it created during the covid-19 impacted period in 2020. Sitting today I can easily say that it was really silly for most of us to stop all our SIPs at that time. By the time we decided to resume our SIP investments, we had lost out on most of the sharp dips &ndash; which could have been such lucrative entry points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">S: Yea&hellip; you are right. It&rsquo;s really important to keep calm and not panic during such times. In hindsight it truly feels good for our slightly delayed but cautious investment decisions. After all,&nbsp;<em>Better late than Never</em>. An even analysis proves this &ndash; be it the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 or the Covid-19 impact in the world markets, the volatility experienced during those few months scared most of the investors. But if we behave as long term investors, we must zoom out on the entire chart of the equity markets &ndash; that clearly highlights the recovery, rebound and rise of the markets, indicating its resilience from such shocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A: True&hellip; look at our portfolios. We have made such good gains since 2020. The investments made then are reaping us good returns. You must thank those investments for our last year&rsquo;s Masai-Mara&rsquo;s adventures!!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">S: Haha&hellip;.absolutely&hellip; it was so much fun!! And look at the other asset classes as well&hellip;gold..?? It has shown such amazing returns over the last few years. I am so glad we made those investment in 2019 in the Sovereign Gold Bonds. We are benefiting from regular returns plus the appreciation gains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A: True&hellip; that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to sensibility diversify the investment portfolio. And always believe in strategic SIPs, and not just standard SIPs. Enter the market &ndash; whatever be the investment asset &ndash; at the right time! Look at ESG investments that had become the flavor of all investors five years back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">S: Absolutely&hellip;even we try to sensitize our children at school about the environment related issues. The world has been witnessing so many environment related issues &ndash; global warming leading to bushfires in our forests, melting of glaciers causing unprecedented floods, earthquake catastrophes, and so much more. The corona virus totally shook the entire health system of the world &ndash; sensitizing people and corporates towards social responsibility took a totally different meaning since then.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A: Yes, after all we all are stakeholders of this planet. We must take care of it and keep the same in mind while making prudent investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">S: The market has rewarded stocks with steady business performance and quality growth, irrespective of their market capitalisation. Companies with good, clean managements were rewarded handsomely by the markets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A: Also, look at the pace at which investments in international equity and digital assets has risen in last five years! We couldn&rsquo;t envisage this rapid growth at that point in time. These are becoming an acceptable asset class for any retail investor&rsquo;s portfolio diversification!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">S: Absolutely! Lesson learnt &ndash;&nbsp;<em>One should&nbsp;<strong>ACT</strong>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<strong>REACT</strong></em>.&nbsp;<em>Long-term investment success is almost totally a function of how one emotionally handles declines in the equity market, as opposed to how one&rsquo;s portfolio handles them.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Shweta and Akshay may still take some time to reach their destination.

We are at the cusp of rebooting the world economic growth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688016983/qkmvkdk1ihjukxciavdx.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 747px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, what&rsquo;s working for India? Should we trust the lollapalooza effect to catalyse our economic growth engine in the next few years? Lollapalooza effect was coined by the renowned investor Charles Munger aka Charlie. He often attaches the word &ldquo;effects&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;lollapalooza effects&rdquo;) which means that multiple factors are acting together in ways that are feeding back on each other. In simple words, lollapalooza effect is an outcome which is far bigger than the sum of the parts, as in 2+2 is not equal to 4 (linear) but 22 (exponential).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Using this mental construct of lollapalooza, one can explain the cause-effect relationship behind extreme events in the world. Not only explain, but Lollapalooza helps us understand the workings of this complex world so that we can leverage that for our benefit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Several factors are working simultaneously in favour of India: strong image in the world &ndash; stable government and leadership perception &ndash; robust macro-economic fundamentals &ndash; steady and sustained capital inflows &ndash; favourable impact on current account surplus due to the drop in oil prices &ndash; reduced terms of trade with China &ndash; looking inwards at our core strength of huge demographic dividend to be reaped from the young workforce &ndash; the rapid pace of digitization &ndash; supportive sectoral policies &ndash; good monsoons for the agriculture-dependent industries &ndash; declining interest rates to boost liquidity in the banking sector and push investment &ndash; channelling of surplus liquidity by RBI through the banking system- kick start growth &ndash; higher investments in economic and social infrastructure, and many more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">These green shoots are clearly visible for the Indian economy to chart a sustainable growth path ahead and lead the world out of the current pandemic created economic slowdown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688017006/xo6gstogf3ljn5v2umh2.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 606px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">However, not all may be hunky-dory by getting swirled in the whirlpool of lollapalooza. We have many cognitive biases that can sway our behaviour one way or another. All these psychological tendencies work at a subconscious level. We tend to make decisions based on readily available information. Munger believes the&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>&lsquo;lollapalooza effect&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;</span>can result in herd mentality, the more individuals follow a certain idea/behaviour, the better we consider the idea to be!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With the advent of social media, everyone has the power to shout their opinions openly. The incessant noise from the TV channels, financial newspapers etc aggravates the&nbsp;<strong>recency bias and social validation</strong>&nbsp;in an investor&rsquo;s mind. But isolated facts get you nowhere. They need to come together on a framework of theory, to become usable. In the words of Emile Auguste Chartier:<strong>&lsquo;Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it&rsquo;s the only one you have&rsquo;</strong><strong>.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Understanding the lollapalooza effect would assist in safeguarding ourselves from committing common mistakes and help find important investment opportunities. So, focus on buying quality and growth, avoid repeating expensive errors and be more confident while investing.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dear Investors, let&rsquo;s enjoy the Indian lollapalooza music festival, dance on the beats and beware of the noise!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agarwal Ph.D.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688017104/pm1xagtbmqwnyz21uyy7.jpg","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Trust the Lollapalooza Effect!","seo_keywords":"Trust the Lollapalooza Effect!","seo_description":"We will shortly enter into a new world – the post COVID world.

Many are under the trap of Covid Virus and many more are trapped under the side effects of Covid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Salaries have either gone for a toss or have reduced. Businessmen are severely affected because they carry the responsibility of many other people working for their factories/organisations. Paying salary from the savings without any inflow is like cutting a heart. I wonder how long will they continue to bleed. I pray for everyones well being and fast recovery from this mayhem.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Some concerns which investors have shown during this crisis are very genuine and accordingly its important to make best efforts to guide the investor to take right steps. Therefore, I have tried to pen down the two repeated questions which I have faced lately and have tried to judiciously answer them here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><b>1) Why&nbsp;</b><b>didn&rsquo;t</b><b>&nbsp;we come out of equity market before the Covid crisis? Why didn&rsquo;t research team pick up this crisis in advance?</b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">From the above question, we can easily sense that the query is related to the timing of market. Entering at bottom and exiting at top is a mission which investors always want us to perform. But its very difficult to perfectly time. I would like to state this as a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.&nbsp; This is because, advisor being human being take decisions on the basis of available information, research and from his past experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The reason why we couldn&rsquo;t perfectly time the exit before the Covid crisis is as under:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">a) The receipt of information about Covid from World Health Organization was vague. In early days, WHO communicated that Covid virus was from the family of SARS, Ebola etc. and hence was not so contagious &amp; fatal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">b) Information from the birthplace of COVID i.e. China was improper and incomplete. They were hiding the actual infections and death toll. We all know that China is a black box as far as information is concerned. The same can be related with the fact that till now they have not declared the number of Chinese army personnel who died recently in Galwan valley clash with India.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Due to above stated reasons, we couldn&rsquo;t manage to exit equity market before the Covid crisis. Even the biggest of investors like Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio, Howard Marks, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala etc. couldn&rsquo;t exit the equity before coronavirus crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2) What is the future prospect of recovery and what strategy one should play at this juncture?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Out of 15k level correction in Sensex, 11k level has already been recovered which is 73% of recovery from the peak of 41k level. Although strength of infectious people and deaths are increasing, but still market is recovering at a good pace.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is majorly due to global liquidity, opening of lockdowns and acceptance of new normal by adaptable humans. This fast recovery clearly shows that no one can time the market and forecast its movement perfectly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors waiting for deep bottom in the market are still waiting and has lost major upside. Therefore rather than making any financial decisions on the basis of hunches, investor must stick to strategies that have been created after research, thinking and thorough planning, which are as follows: &ndash;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">a) Stock market has seen several corrections like this in the past and eventually it has always recovered. The same can be seen in below chart. So it is certain that market would eventually recover.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688017344/i5psbcexxk9xtixo0ppt.webp\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 434px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">b) After the crisis, equity market always recovers to a new high level i.e. it breaches the previous high level to touch new peak. Economy readjusts itself to a new and growth supporting reality where interest rates are low, oil prices are subdued, rupee is weakened which supports export, business models are new &amp; evolved etc. Once economy starts moving again, big investors like FIIs deploy more than what they had taken out at the time of downturn.

The outlook for the entire markets &ndash; both equity and debt has undergone a change. The sectors have been impacted differently and several opportunities have been created for the investors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conventional businesses with relatively low entry barriers are highly vulnerable. Fundamentally, strong companies can survive in this era of disruption by proactively acknowledging and investing in disruptive innovation. Investors need to pay attention to these trends, intensifying turmoil in the economy and devote time and money for harnessing returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The &lsquo;unicorn&rsquo; and &lsquo;decacorn&rsquo; phenomenon of highly valued disruptive start-ups indicates stepping up of turbulence. 18 Indian unicorns have emerged across different sectors and industries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Recently, Accenture, in its report for India, published &lsquo;Disruptability index&rsquo;, which measures the current level of disruption, and susceptibility to future disruption. The research found that 44&nbsp;percent of companies are currently experiencing disruption, and 38 percent are susceptible to future disruption.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Readers, several trends are the driving force behind the creative destruction, ranging from the massive disruption in retail, increased digitalization, the rise of the software-enabled online platforms to the emergence of clean energy and increased globalisation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Disruptions encompassing technological advances, cloud computing and artificial intelligence indicate further turmoil enabling quick scaling up of operations, global reach and no geographical limitations in expansion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Globally, the energy sector has witnessed a sharp decline in its weight in the index, as cleantech is gaining prominence and oil prices are descending. Increased investment in renewable sources has for the first time exceeded the traditional energy resources i.e. fossil fuels. The S&amp;P Global Clean Energy index confirms this trend with a one-year total return of 19.20% in contrast to -38.27% by the S&amp;P Global 1200 Energy Index, as on 3 July 2020.

Looking at the rate at which the GDP recovers from such slumps &ndash; &nbsp;a V-shaped recovery, W-shaped recovery or a swoosh shaped recovery is expected post the current pandemic driven slowdown. It can be clearly seen from the GDP growth (%) graph depicted below &ndash; the GDP growth rate plummets sharply during these economic shocks, however, it has strong resilience to bounce back the next year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>India GDP Movement and Annual Change</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688018025/z7tz6fvkn11zknp5dosj.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 531px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is an econometric concept wherein most of the macro-economic indicators are a stationary time series.

Markets are not alien to a crisis. Globally, markets have survived various crises like natural disasters, wars, terror attacks, and have bounced back stronger. Despite the Asian Currency Crisis (1997), 9/11 disaster (2001), the Global Financial Crisis (2008), US Sovereign Rating Downgrade (2011), China&rsquo;s Economic Slowdown (2015), and COVID-19 (2020), the Sensex has grown and moved up. &nbsp;The performance of Sensex since 1994 is shown in the graph depicted below.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Sensex Movement Since 1994</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688018071/cavivr4xgao0cd30o22w.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 680px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Though, the other economic shocks as indicated in the graph may have had a limited geographical spread as compared to the current covid pandemic, it would be prudent to assume a steady and gradual recovery path in GDP growth rates and parallel in the asset returns across the globe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So readers, its not the time to panic. It&rsquo;s an opportunity &ndash; it&rsquo;s the time to prevail! As investors &ndash; hold onto your horses &ndash; stay patient, don&rsquo;t panic and stay invested. These are opportune times for India and it is likely to attract massive investments in times to come. The Indian economy has robust fundamentals and is more resilient as compared to its peers. The industry will reboot, new sectors will flourish, business models will change, the investments will grow and the consumption driven economy of india will surely chart the revived growth path in times ahead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Certainly readers &ndash; &lsquo;Stay Home!

Is there no correlation between market and economy? Are markets manipulated?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">According to us, there are two primary reasons for the rise of equity market despite weak economy.

This must be making us think that market is primarily driven by liquidity and it&rsquo;s a bubble in making as ground realities of economy are still not good.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above possibility cannot be completely ruled out but what we also need to consider is that equity market is future indicator of the economy. Equity market leads the economy by 6-12 months. This means that equity market moves ahead of the actual GDP or earnings growth. Equity market falls before the slowdown in corporate earnings and it also goes up before the increase of earnings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The same can be seen in following chart:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688018484/oswnxbfpfowhkp6olcg5.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 782px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>*Source &ndash; Factset, US Market</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above chart shows that during Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, US S&amp;P 500 had started going ahead much before the improvement in corporate earnings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So there is a good possibility that markets have already discounted the negative growth in GDP for 2020 and is looking at positive growth of GDP from 2021 onwards. It should also be considered that liquidity and stimulus provided by Governments across the globe is in right direction as they help in faster revival of economy, consumptions and corporate earnings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So is the worst over for equity market and will market continue to go up from here?

It is important to stay invested in equity during this course of market volatility. Timing the market on the basis of future outlook is very difficult as future movement of market is dependent on too many permutations and combinations. The right way to time the market is on the basis of valuation. Investors should buy when market falls as valuations become attractive and book profit when market goes up as valuations get stretched.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Happy Investing!</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688018678/laxjyaz4sunjr6cmqbar.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Disconnect between Equity Market and Real Economy – Explained","seo_keywords":"Disconnect between Equity Market and Real Economy – Explained","seo_description":"A common question going in the mind of majority of people is that why is the equity market going up when there is so much of gloom around.

Market liquidity suddenly evaporated for NBFCs &amp; HFCs.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors started redeeming from debt mutual funds which had exposure to questionable NBFCs &amp; HFCs and this led to increased pressure on them for repayment of Loans.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The NBFCs which had lending book with predominant exposure to real estate developers, home loans and infrastructure funding came into radar. The loans given by these NBFC had a long term tenure of 5-20 Years. And now suddenly NBFCs had liquidity pressure from mutual funds, banks, investors etc for repayment of loan.&nbsp; This led to Asset Liability Mismatch (ALM).</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Even NBFCs which had good assets came into problem because they didn&rsquo;t plan their cashflows well. They were borrowing for short term from the market and were lending for long term to their customers.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">NBFCs had lent heavily to real estate developers. With real estate sector going through a bad phase, developers were themselves not in a position to payback to NBFCs. Developers started defaulting which led to vicious circle of defaults leading to loss for retail and HNI investors.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Eventually, this resulted in loss of confidence for companies like DHFL, Reliance Capital, Indiabulls, Edelweiss, IIFL, Piramal Enterprise, Yes Bank etc.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Who is responsible for all this mess?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>&ldquo;Many times the Good we create leads to Evil that destroys us&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>&ndash; Amish Tripathi</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Demonetisation, RERA and GST were some of the policies introduced by Government in the last few years with the intention of reducing black economy and for increasing the compliance. Demonetisation led to huge cash in the bank accounts of people. For better return on this cash, the liquidity started moving to fixed deposits, debt mutual funds, equity mutual funds, equity shares etc. Sudden spurge in investment led to bubble everywhere. Banks started lending money aggressively to NBFCs which further started funding the real estate developers; debt mutual funds also started lending aggressively to real estate developers and NBFCs; equity market started going through a bull run etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The processes, due diligence, financial prudence etc. all got compromised during this aggressive lending by banks and mutual funds to NBFCs and real estate developers. Unfortunately, the gatekeepers like credit rating agencies, regulators, Government officials also didn&rsquo;t react on time to stop/ restrict the creation of financial bubble.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Directly or indirectly, majority of the lending was done to real estate. The whole of real estate sector has been going through pain in the last few years because of demand supply mismatch, higher compliance due to RERA and GST, reduction in black economy due to demonetisation etc. When main borrower is going through financial trouble then all the lenders get affected. This was the crux of all the trouble.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What is the future outlook?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The current financial crisis is more like a confidence crisis. There is a complete loss of confidence in financial sector. People have become very risk averse and no one is ready to lend or invest in any NBFC or HFC which have higher exposure to real estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fastest way to come out of this crisis is by getting Government support. Confidence building measures for financial sector by Government can ease the pain quickly the way it had happened in 2009 after subprime crisis. The Government has recognised the NBFC crisis and has taken some measures for improvement but they are still not substantial and concrete.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">If Government doesn&rsquo;t extend support then NBFC crisis may continue for some more time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The good news is that it has been a year since the crisis began. Its a known fact that time is the biggest healer. In the last 12 months, balance sheets of NBFCs have improved, debt mutual funds have restructured their portfolios, credit rating agencies and regulators have become more active. Hopefully, we are at the bottom of crisis and things will get better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What is the impact on Debt Mutual Funds?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Default by companies like IL&amp;FS, DHFL, Reliance ADAG, Essel, Altico etc has impacted some of the debt mutual funds which had exposure to these papers.

Like bull and bear run of equity, the debt market also goes through periods of crest and trough. In the downturn of debt, there will be some issues and defaults. This has happened in the past as well like in the years 2008 &amp; 2013 and it will continue to happen in future. The important part is that we need to be thorough in our risk management so that our exposure to toxic assets is on the lower side and has less impact on portfolio return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Its important to understand that debt funds have advantages like tax arbitrage (Debt funds get taxed at approx. 5%-10% whereas fixed deposit gets taxed as per income tax slab), has high liquidity, better return etc. The down cycle of debt which comes in every 4-6 years will have a negative impact of ~1%-2% in that year. If the negative impact of ~1.5% is spread across 5 years then net impact per year is approx. 0.3%. The benefit from tax arbitrage, extra return etc in debt funds is far higher than the impact cost. So overall debt mutual funds are safe and give better return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What is the portfolio strategy followed to prevent unwanted risk?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">At Alpha Capital our core focus is on Wealth Preservation.

Stock markets have behaved erratically, while they posted worst losses in history on March 23, 2020, two days later after the announcement of the lock down, they posted their highest gains in 11 years, adding $66 billion to investor wealth. But on April 1, 2020, the markets slumped dramatically again.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India&rsquo;s lock down also means the world&rsquo;s largest lock down, which translates into all factories, shops, markets being closed, public transport shut and construction work coming to a grinding halt.&nbsp; While lock down may be a temporary phase or may need to be imposed later depending on the complexity of the situation, the Indian economy is moving at a snail&rsquo;s pace due to the COVID 19 impact.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On March 27, Moody&rsquo;s Investor Service brought down India&rsquo;s estimate of GDP for the year from 5.3 percent to 2. 5 percent.&nbsp; Due to social distancing and avoidance of public-related activity, the travel and live events industry have been the worst hit. The live events industry has estimated a loss of Rs. 3000 crore and the tourism industry is staring at a loss of Rs. 15000 crores for the months of March and April, alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On March 26, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $23 billion package to tackle the slipping financial situation in the country, by providing sector-related incentives, funds for food security, healthcare and extensions for tax deadlines. On March 27, the Reserve Bank of India introduced sharp interest rate cuts and other measures to introduce credit available for affected businesses with an injection of $52&nbsp;billion (Rs. 374,000 crore) to the economy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The country&rsquo;s premier private bank HDFC in its treasury reports a loss of Rs. 10 lakh crores in the first half of 2020. This translates into a slashing of 74 percent of the real GDP within the time frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the report, the next quarter will be positive but still weak. The report said the service sector was the most hit, especially during the lock down because of lack of delivery of non-essentials.&nbsp; The impact on manufacturing industry has not been much, especially for essentials like food, beverage, medicine and pharma products.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The RBI has also announced a cut in the Repo-rate by 75 basis points, with a 90-bps cut in the reverse Repo-rate to curtail the effects of the pandemic on the economy.&nbsp; Due to this move, banks are in a position to pass the rate cut benefits to customers.&nbsp; Banks also deferred payments of EMIs on various loans including home loans, auto loans, for a period of 3 months, under the term laid by the COVID 19 RBI package.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How should one plan&rsquo;s one personal finance during COVID 19?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With lock down and various restrictions being imposed time to time to battle the Corona virus, there is a looming fear of late salaries, pay cuts and even worse, job losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is important to have an emergency corpus equivalent to 6 months of expenses, including EMIs. If you do not have an emergency fund right now, start saving proactively for the next two months, so that you have funds to bank upon for dealing with uncertainties like pay cuts and job loss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In any case due to the pandemic, going out for entertainment, travel and eating out at fancy restaurants have been cut down. This saved money can be used to fund your emergency corpus.&nbsp; Avoid splurging on smart TVs and cars or going for another EMI during this period and divert the money towards creating an emergency fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Park your funds in liquids funds or ultra-short-term funds, where you can get better interest rates than your savings account.&nbsp; Keep investing in your mutual funds SIP. Only when it is very difficult due to paying off certain loans, can you skip it temporarily. But if you can, continue to invest in mutual funds, because it is smart thinking to invest when the market is on the low, because you can buy more units with the given price. When the market moves up, the value of these units will rise, helping you maximize your wealth creation process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ensure that you are well insured individually and as a family.&nbsp; Imagine the impact if there is a job loss and a health crisis.&nbsp; If you are a family of four people, invest in a&nbsp; good family floater cover of at least 5 lakhs to begin with. There are a lot of super-top plans which come to play when the base sum insured is used, which you can take advantage of.&nbsp; You can also go for a critical illness policy cover, which provides instant emergency cash, when faced with a major illness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For an individual living in a metro city, a minimum health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakh is needed.&nbsp; Just because your office has a health insurance program in place, doesn&rsquo;t meet you don&rsquo;t need to have one.&nbsp; If there is a job loss, the cover provided by the employer is lapsed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Do not stop paying your EMIs and honor them as much as possible, because stopping your payments an affect your credit score.&nbsp; You can ask the lending bank for a temporary stoppage on your installments, without late charges or penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since interest rate on unsecured debt like credit cards are the highest, make sure that you always pay your credit card bills. And as much as possible, limit use of credit cards in tough times, unless necessary.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688019963/lo7i6ozcz5ghoebqdaq9.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"The Impact of Corona virus on Indian Economy and Personal Finance","seo_keywords":"The Impact of Corona virus on Indian Economy and Personal Finance","seo_description":"Economies across the world, including India have been hit hard by the Corona virus crisis.

According to this section, HUF/Hindu Undivided Families or individuals can seek a maximum tax deduction of INR 1.5 lakhs from the gross income, for investments or expenditures made in specific areas, and then calculate the total taxable income for the specific financial year. It is important to note that the tax deduction can be claimed by an individual or HUFs only if the investment or expense is made in the financial year that the tax return is filed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When the tax deduction is claimed, the total gross income on which taxes need to be paid becomes less as compared to the real income. For instance, if your yearly income is INR 7.5 lakhs and you have invested/spent INR 1.5 lakhs on the specific areas which are allowed for tax deduction as per the laws, then the total taxable amount after the deduction will be INR 6 lakhs. Thus, you will need to pay taxes on INR 6 lakhs of income after the deductions instead of INR 7.5 lakhs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>For Rs. 1.5 lakh invested towards tax saving, here is the tax deduction claimed under Section 80C</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&nbsp;Income Tax Rate</strong></span></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Tax Deductions</strong></span></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">5 per cent</span></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">7800</span></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">20 per cent</span></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">31,200</span></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">30 per cent.</span></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"213\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">46,800</span></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>Tax savings are inclusive of cess at 4 per cent.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Section 80C of the IT Act explained</strong></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Section 80C of the IT Act is one of the most common options used by tax payers to save on income tax. In addition to specific kinds of investments, individuals and HUFs can also avail of tax deductions on specific expenses under this section. Presented below are some details about Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most of us put our monies into PPF/Public Provident Fund, insurance policies, and ELSS/equity-linked savings schemes, etc. to reap the benefits of tax deduction under 80C. However, there is also a host of other tax saving investment choices that we fail to take into account. As mentioned above, tax savings can be availed for not just investments but also for certain kinds of expenses. But, such expenditures have to be made in the same financial year as the tax year so as to be able to avail of the tax deductions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is important to understand the below listed facts when trying to claim a tax deduction under Section 80C of the IT Act:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The tax bracket plays a major role in determining the amount of money that can be saved as tax deduction by individuals and HUFs under Section 80C.

In a way, financial planners are akin to psychologists or life coaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; They go beyond financial planning; they help you nurture a habit of discipline and focused attitude towards life.</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Creating a financial plan is something any financial planner can do. But a good financial planner works on developing an individual&rsquo;s mindset towards understanding the importance of goal setting, the art of balancing investments with expenditure, and the exponential power of compounding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We all have the ability to grow rich and contribute handsomely to ourselves, our family and our society. Being rich gives you the ability to contribute to humanity.&nbsp; As you can see in this COVID 19 crisis, it is the millionaires and billionaires with progressive mindset, who have come forward with generous donations. Why? Because they have the will and the ability to create a positive change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Seeds of wealth are created in our habits.&nbsp; Habits are nothing but behavioral pattern that is repeated regularly to an extent that it becomes a part of our personality.&nbsp; When you do something continuously or regularly, it becomes familiar to us, so much that we can do it without much resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is something that we may abhor, we tend to develop a certain amount of curiosity or interest in something if we end up doing repeatedly.&nbsp; When we develop an interest, we tend to excel in that task or endeavor, till we attain a certain amount of mastery on that subject.&nbsp; This is just simple neuroscience &ndash; the more you behave in a certain way, or the perform you perform an action, the more it gets physically wired into&nbsp; your brain and becomes a part of your daily routine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Knowledge is one of the best ways to create interest and develop the base for a good habit to thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a not-so-aware individual reads or watches videos on investment benefits,&nbsp; the process of investing, the various financial products,&nbsp; the power of compounding, the facts and myths that surround investment practices; she or he understands that while the&nbsp; world of finance may not be as glamorous as entertainment, it is essential enough, and has the power to influence, leverage and positively impact every aspect of life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Every action starts with a WHY. Once you are clear about why you want to do a particular thing, you will figure out the &lsquo;HOW&rsquo;, meaning, you will look for resources that help you reach towards the goal.&nbsp; Since you are already in the plan, you will begin to evaluate your progress, with the WHAT (what are you actually doing).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Applying the above concepts to the world of investments &ndash; the &lsquo;WHY&rsquo; is the financial goal that you have, the &lsquo;How&rsquo; is the process of achieving that goal in a particular time frame.&nbsp; For instance, the &lsquo;WHY&rsquo; may be a big house that you want to buy in 10 years, the &lsquo;How&rsquo; is the selection of the right asset-mix that helps compound your investments and the WHAT is the analysis of the returns that you can get at the end of 10 years. You can also weigh the pros and cons of a particular investment with the &lsquo;WHAT&rsquo; analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Habits and discipline go hand-in hand.&nbsp; So, when you have made up your mind to invest regularly in the form of say, monthly SIPS, then you will develop the discipline to ensure that you stick to the plan, against all odds.&nbsp; True, there can be financial hurdles, missed SIPs, crises of various kinds; but if you have set your eyes on the goal, you will continue to invest in your dream. This is because times change, and nothing is constant &ndash; what takes you through is your disciplined mindset.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let&rsquo;s say, the 40 year old Akash wants to earn Rs. 40 lakh at the end of 5 years to fund for a house.&nbsp; Here is how he can work with a good mutual fund financial planner who not only charts out a solid plan but also helps get excited about going after his goal.&nbsp; &nbsp;The financial planner, at the same time, will keep expectations realistic and give him a clear picture taking into account his risk appetite, tax slab and future investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&nbsp;In this case, on an average, considering a 12 percent expected rate of return, and investing Rs. 50000 per month as SIP, Akash will have invested Rs.30 lakh with earnings of 11,24,319, taking the total SIP value at&nbsp; 41,24,319. To reach this goal, the financial planner will help plan the right kind of asset mix, including balanced funds, liquids funds and equities to help him reach that figure.</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Of course, we cannot predict the future- the actual figure may be lesser or more than 40 lakhs, depending on various factors like market dynamics, rate of inflation, individual&rsquo;s risk appetite etc.&nbsp; However, one thing is for sure, if you stay invested, you are better off getting to that figure than just squandering money, being in a debt-trap, or keeping money in the bank with minuscule returns.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688020774/empwbxaluo7cxyaly90u.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"How Good Habits Can Change Your Financial Destiny During COVID 19 Crisis","seo_keywords":"How Good Habits Can Change Your Financial Destiny During COVID 19 Crisis","seo_description":"Financing planning is not just about knowing which investment instruments to invest in; it is about having the right attitude and discipline to brave tough situations and focus on your goals.

The US market may start going up 1-2 weeks before the peak of new cases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the peak out of new cases in US will happen in 1st week of May. This is again a prediction, it may happen in end of May, end of April or may have already happened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The current status of new cases in the US is as under:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688020893/sxyxrdl7ksmg2fiwwb5i.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 679px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) play an important role in Indian equity market and are big market movers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The FIIs sold in Feb 2020 &amp; March 2020 and have been net buyers in April 2020 as seen below:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688020910/jlnid1ezbdii5qz4xt5o.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 266px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sensex was down in Feb and March of 2020 and has been positive in April 2020 which is similar to the movement of FII buying as shown in the above table.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We would like to highlight that FIIs are not the only movers of Indian market. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), HNIs etc. are also important factors but it can definitely be said that FIIs are big movers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We feel that when new cases of Covid-19 peak out in the US, then sentiments will change and FIIs will become net buyers in India and other emerging countries. This will lead to equity market rally and help in covering most of the recent losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">2) The second phase of market movement will depend on how the economy of India behaves. We will need answers to the following questions:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">How long does the Covid 19 crisis run in India?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">How much of the Indian economy gets hurt because of the Covid 19 crisis?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">What kind of fiscal and monetary support is given by Indian Government and RBI?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">How long does it take for Indian economy to recover?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">When do corporate earnings start growing at good rate?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As of now, we don&rsquo;t have answers to the above questions. The situation is changing every day. We are watching, analyzing and trying to look at various probabilities of outcomes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Based on above two phases, it can be said that future movement of Indian equity market will depend on how the Covid-19 crisis moves in US and India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We are getting better visibility of the US developments and feel that FIIs should come back to Indian market soon which will help in recovering good part of the recent losses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Indian part of the story is still playing out and we are hoping to get better picture soon. We are watching the Covid-19 spread in India, impact on economy and Government actions closely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Would like to highlight that the above analysis is to form a view on the movement of equity market in shorter term. We continue to be bullish on equity with a long-term horizon of 5 year plus. We feel that the currently volatility is a short-term issue which will get resolved soon and market will continue to run upward in long term and deliver expected return.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For investor, its important to have patience and give equity enough time to perform. Short term volatility is the nature of equity and is very much expected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Take care and stay safe.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688021106/olqsc9przigzqet37icg.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Where will Indian Equity Market go from here – Up or Down?","seo_keywords":"Where will Indian Equity Market go from here – Up or Down?","seo_description":"We would like to highlight that FIIs are not the only movers of Indian market.

Big industries like Auto, Media, Retail, Travel, Financial Services etc. are all getting disrupted because of new business innovations. The disruption is being led by companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Uber etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">India continues to spend and consume which is mainly driven by huge middle income class but good part of the benefit is taken by the above tech companies which are not listed in Indian Stock Market. Majority of these tech companies are listed in US Stock Exchange.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Lately, the correlation between earning of companies listed in India and GDP growth of India has broken down. In the last 10 years, nominal GDP growth of India has averaged 13% per annum, while the popular benchmark index in India , the Nifty, has seen its earnings grow at ~8% per annum. Nifty has underperformed nominal GDP growth on an average by 5%.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">On the other hand, in America, the nominal GDP growth over the last 10 years has been ~4% and the US S&amp;P 500 earnings has grown at ~12% per annum. The earnings growth of US listed companies is ~4% per annum more than Nifty companies of India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The primary reason for US companies doing so well is that US companies now get ~30% of their revenue from outside US. And this continues to go up every year. Majority of the innovations and tech disruptions are happening from US which are leading to faster growth for companies in US.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>This scenario is also captured in the performance of index return.

When FIIs sell in Indian market then they sell rupee and buy US Dollars which leads to US Dollar appreciating when Indian market falls. Also, because of interest rate differential between US and India, the US dollar in long term appreciates by ~3%-4% per annum.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>The above information definitely creates a beautiful picture for investing in US market but one needs to also understand the risk.

If you will look back and try to recollect the moments of last 10 years, you will realise that there are very few special moments that you are able to recollect. But overall, we are sure that wonderful and good things have happened in your life in this decade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For India, the decade of 2010-2020 has been fantastic. The e-commerce, startups, smart phone, electric vehicle and other disruptions are all part of this decade. Sensex gave a return of 136% in this decade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It&rsquo;s also a good time to plan for the next decade and set some goals around health, family, wealth, career, etc. Setting the goals is good and important as it gives life a direction and some meaning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For some people, achievement of goals is easy as they are very focused and disciplined. But for most of the people, it&rsquo;s not easy and its like moving a huge block.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">&lsquo;The Kaizen Way&rsquo; is a popular book written by Dr. Robert Maurer. The book talks about the secret behind Japanese innovation and quality. The book is a good read and can indeed help us in moving the huge block.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per book, most intentions for change seek a transformative move&mdash;something significant to be achieved once and for all, in a short period. &ldquo;Big and bold steps&rdquo; is the mantra of many professionals and companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Real change, however, takes time and is difficult. We become overwhelmed with the magnitude of the effort and persistence required to lose twenty kilograms, save up for retirement or stabilize a sinking relationship. As with most New Year resolutions, we&rsquo;ll meet with success temporarily, only to find ourselves slipping back into our old ways as soon as the initial burst of enthusiasm fades out.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Maurer conceives transformative change as an endless, continuous process of gradual improvements. By breaking daunting tasks into absurdly little steps, we feel little resistance to change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One small step leads to the next, which leads to one more, and so on&mdash;finally leading us to our goal of transformative change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Maurer relates this approach to Kaizen, the famed Japanese system of obsessive tinkering and continuous, incremental improvement. Kaizen involves making continual, small adjustments to lifestyle to not only improve speed and quality, but also save resources.

The key for moving the water wheel faster is to pour water on the wheel regularly and steadily and gradually increase the flow of water. The continuous flow of water creates the momentum in wheel and the speed increases exponentially as the quantum of water is gradually increased.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Similarly, for wealth creation, its good if we can begin with small regular investment to make the wheel move and gradually increase the investment for momentum to be created. For making the start, quantum of money is not relevant. What&rsquo;s important is to take the plunge and then gradually increase the saving and investment amount to create the magic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The kaizen theory when applied to Systematic Investment plan (SIP) can lead to magical results.

The logic behind such thought and belief is that businesses tend to become big only when it provides happiness to its customers. This may be true and just as well may not be true.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above belief is however far from being true when it comes to the area of mutual funds (MF).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Many investors are of the opinion that the size of a mutual fund scheme, i.e., the amount of money managed by a mutual fund house, is an important factor to consider when investing in mutual funds. This however is not true and has no actual basis to stand on. There is no intrinsic cause for a smaller fund to be worse than a larger mutual fund. If a smaller MF as compared to a larger MF of the same category shows better performance and track record, then it is but obvious that investors should opt for the smaller fund.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The reason for the above discussed belief of investors cannot be attributed to just the presumption of &lsquo;big tends to be good.&rsquo; Another cause of the belief is the fact that sellers of bigger mutual funds tend to actively promote such notions since it offers them an extra handle to advertise their MF against other funds which may be performing better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Bigger mutual funds are better: Does it hold any real validity?</strong></span><br />\r\nA comparison of information available about the performance of varied funds shows that a slightly bigger fraction of larger MFs have better performance as opposed to smaller MFs. This observation is however scattered and quite small. There are several great smaller funds and there are several bad big MFs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors should take extra care to avoid falling into the trap of mistaking reason with effect. Mutual funds which have a track record of good returns over a long period of time generally become bigger due to increased influx of investor funds into them and such cash gets a longer period to increase and grow. They offered good performance and hence they eventually got bigger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Does &lsquo;smaller mutual funds are better&rsquo; hold water?</strong></span><br />\r\nOne cannot just randomly select a big mutual fund and state that it must be good just because it is big. In a similar vein, one cannot select a smaller mutual fund with a good track record and state that its track record does not matter and one should not invest in it due to the fact that it is small. In addition to the performance of a mutual fund, there are several variables that can play a part in making a fund bigger or keeping it small.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The fact of the matter is that the marketing competence of a large fund house or the influence and reach of its parent company among MF distributors are the main reasons. There may be other variables as well. For instance, there are many equity funds which launched big on the first day itself due to their tremendously hyped NFOs at the top of the fund markets. A few these funds have been found to be lacking and give poor performance each year; however, they continue to remain big funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">It is also important to note that there are numerous comparatively small equity mutual funds in the MF sector which have show good performance over the long term and definitely warrant a perusal. Whenever you think that you would like to invest in this kind of mutual fund, or when praise is heaped on the fund by an analyst, then such an idea is disdainfully dismissed by the sellers of bigger funds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Sellers of larger funds often argue that comparison of an INR 500 crore fund with an INR 5,000 crore fund is not valid. Such an argument is a trick, a subterfuge. Aninvestors is not concerned about the size of a fund or whether or not a fund house measures up to the pecking order in the fund sector. If a mutual fund has given good returns over a period of time and has high rating from rating agencies, then size is irrelevant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Does the size of a mutual fund ever matter?</strong></span><br />\r\nThere are many instances when size of a mutual fund does matter. It may also be noted that for some kinds of big equity funds, size can in fact be a disadvantage. For instance, big mutual funds with focus on mid-cap and small-cap shares may find it difficult to gather sufficient shares that they can put their money in. During the negative cycles of the share markets, such larger mutual funds may experience a double negative of poor liquidity and rapidly reducing values.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The key thing to remember is the fact that investors should not select one fund over the other on the basis of just their size, as doing so may result in you making some really bad investment choices.</span></p>\r\n","is_active":"1","is_draft":"0","blog_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688022311/etshz1feyfrs6ogowigt.webp","published_by_image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1687758943/o9rxxf4fosnurb23hjsv.png","seo_title":"Mutual Fund Size – Does it really matter?","seo_keywords":"Mutual Fund Size – Does it really matter?","seo_description":"It is innate of humans to think that big retail chains, big shops, or big media houses offer better services or goods.

Most of the experts, fund managers, financial institutions etc. have different opinion on equity valuation and accordingly they report different numbers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">With this article we will try to answer the questions related to valuation of Indian equity market so that we are more aware and confident about our investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Why is valuation of equity market important?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Equity valuation tells us whether we are buying/ investing in shares at a low or high price. When we invest at a lower valuation then future expected return becomes higher and vice versa. A simple example of same is that If equity market is assumed to give ~15% in long term then money doubles in 5 years. However, if investment is made at higher valuation then it will take more than 5 years to double the money as expected return come downs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In Jan 2008, Sensex had touched ~21,000 level and valuations were highly stretched, if investment was made at this level then there would have been no growth in investment for next 6 years. But if investment was made in Feb, 2009 when Sensex had fallen to ~8300 Level and valuations were very low then money would have doubled in 6 months.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How to find the correct valuation of equity market?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Finding rough valuation of equity market is not so difficult but getting a good valuation number is challenging. There are various valuation indicators like PE Ratio, PB Ratio, Dividend Yield, GDP to Market Capitalization, PE to Growth Ratio, CAPE , Bond Equity Earnings Yield etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The most simple and popular among these indicators is PE Ratio which is a relative valuation indicator. To judge the right valuation of equity market, an investor can compare current PE Ratio with average or fair level of PE Ratio. Example &ndash; If current PE Ratio is 24 and fair level of PE Ratio is 20 then it can be said that equity market is overvalued by 20%</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Why is it difficult to find the exact valuation and why do opinions vary?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The opinion on valuation varies because data source and methodology used for calculation are different sometimes. But it also means that we should use correct data &amp; methodology and come at right valuation because with investment decisions we can&rsquo;t afford to do mistakes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">For simplicity purpose, from here on, we will use only PE Ratio as a reference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Here are some of the difference in reported PE Ratios:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688022868/dvjlgmbkmazkpfd07y4x.png\" style=\"width: 1080px; height: 403px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><em>&nbsp;*as on 23/8/19</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above table shows huge difference in PE Ratio reported by both Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">In various interviews/ media articles of financial experts, fund managers, institutions etc. different PE Ratio gets reported. Sometimes Forward PE Ratio of 1, 2 and 3 years also gets used which makes the decision making even more difficult.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How do we calculate right PE Ratio at Alpha Capital?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We believe that if some noise is removed from the data then we can get correct and meaningful information. To find the right PE Ratio and valuation of market, we do the following:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Analyse individual stocks in each Index and create synthetic Indexes at our own level.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remove those stocks from calculation which have negative earnings. Stocks with negative earnings increases the overall PE Ratio unwantedly.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Reduce the impact of companies which are outliers. For example some companies have very high PE Ratios because of low earnings or because of high expected growth in future. These outliers can increase the overall average of PE Ratio. Example &ndash; Trent Ltd has PE Ratio of 171. Outliers are removed by using median instead of mean as a measure for computation of average.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The synthetic index which we create gives equal weight to all stocks in the Index. Higher weightage is not given to stocks which are large by market capitalization.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Because of above smoothening of data, we get following PE Ratio for various Indexes:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688022891/f0vlj9xym66k198tah0h.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 616px;\" type=\"image\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><em>*as on 23/8/19</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">We believe that fair value of PE Ratio is 20.

The primary reasons are listed below:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Corporate earnings have been poor in the last few years</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The earnings for NSE 500 has been almost flat in last 4 years and has grown at ~4% p.a. in last 9 years.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Unfriendly regulatory and taxation changes</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Demonetization, tax on long term capital of equity, increase of tax surcharge on Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) etc.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Categorization and rationalization of equity mutual funds by SEBI</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Clear demarcation for exposure in large, mid and small cap stocks was done for equity funds. This led to huge selling of mid cap and small cap stocks.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Stretched valuations of Indian stock market&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Because of good investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) and Indian Mutual Funds in the last few years, equity market had seen huge rally. Since upward market movement was not supported by similar corporate earnings growth, the valuations of Indian stock market had stretched to an all-time high. Other emerging and developed markets are now available at better valuation when compared to India.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Is the pain in equity market over?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Its impossible to predict the equity market in short term. There are too many dynamics into play for movement of equity market. With globalization, these dynamics have become more complex and hence make the prediction even more difficult in short term.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What is the current valuation level of Indian equity market?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Valuation of equity market is reflected by various indicators and factors like PE Ratio, PB Ratio, Dividend Yield, expected earnings growth, volatility, company and sector outliers etc. One of the common indicator used for same is PE Ratio. The PE Ratio for top indices in India is given as under:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688023303/yysambbqgezt20gkgn5q.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 526px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The above table shows that PE Ratio is still on the higher side and has good scope for correction. The recent equity market fall has improved the valuation relatively. For example &ndash; PE Ratio of NSE 500 had gone to ~33 and the same has now corrected to 29. However, further fall in equity market from valuation perspective is possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What should investor do now?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The most important thing for an investor to do now is to manage his/ her emotions by not getting seriously affected by equity market volatility. Bull and bear run are all part of market cycle and its natural for market to correct and fall. The good thing about equity is that market (Index and Mutual Funds) always bounces back. What is down today will definitely come up in future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A smart investor is someone who takes advantage of these market swings. He/she books profit when market goes up and buys when market goes down. Similarly, we should look at equity market correction as an opportunity for investment in low price. We should celebrate the market correction and be happy whenever market corrects. &nbsp;Good returns are made when investment is done in fallen market.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">As per empirical research, average investors globally (including India) make only ~40% of Index return in long term.

Coming back home, I noticed things that were not on my list, not needed in the truest sense, but I bought them. When wondering why and how this happened &ndash; I realised it was probably due to the placement of products, limited-time offers, encouraging testimonials, or customer reviews. My academic pursuit of behavioural science tells me it is not a coincidence but a time-tested marketing tactic of using nudges.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>What are Nudges?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Technically, nudges are persuasive techniques that harness human cognitive biases and decision-making shortcuts to guide people towards specific choices or actions. Nudges are designed to influence behaviour without imposing strict rules or removing options.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s unique is that they predictably influence people&rsquo;s behaviour without restricting their choices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">A prevalent nudge is&nbsp;<strong>FOMO</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Fear-of-missing-out).&nbsp;</strong>In this psychological phenomenon, individuals experience anxiety or apprehension when they believe others are participating in rewarding experiences, events, or investments from which they are excluded. It is a potent motivator that drives people to conform, make impulsive decisions, and take unnecessary risks to avoid missing out on potential gains. A survey conducted by a renowned market research firm revealed that 72% of consumers admitted to experiencing FOMO about their personal finances and investment decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Financial institutions or companies often capitalise on nudges by creating content showcasing seemingly overnight success stories, extraordinary returns, and exclusive financial products &amp; opportunities. These carefully curated narratives exploit our desire to keep up with others and instil a sense of urgency to participate, regardless of the quality of financial product or our financial suitability &amp; risk appetite.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remember, the cryptocurrency space!! It witnessed its fair share of FOMO-induced fervour. With the meteoric rise of digital currencies, stories abound of individuals mortgaging their homes or depleting their life savings to ride the wave of crypto euphoria. The allure of quick riches and tales of overnight millionaires seduced many, often leading to financial ruin when the market inevitably corrects itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Recency bias creates a sense of relevance and attractiveness to potential buyers when dealing with trending products. The &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo; can be risky, as trends may be short-lived or subject to volatility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">One more tactic sellers employ is to provide a wide range of investment options, making it seem like abundant choices are available and making buyers feel more comfortable and confident in their decision, even though the actual quality of the products may vary. It becomes evident when one analyses the offerings of various wealth management companies, brokerage firms, or investment platforms that provide numerous options. The sheer variety may overwhelm an investor, making it difficult to assess which products truly align with their goals, leading to decision paralysis or making impulsive choices.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Likewise, more often than not, the advisor sounds more confident than they are. Given their confidence, one must not forget that any year may wreck an excellent investment strategy, and random strategies may succeed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How do investors react?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors driven by FOMO may make impulsive investment decisions without proper due diligence. They may fail to analyse the cost benefit analysis of the financial products or consider their risk tolerance, investment goals, and the long-term sustainability of the investment, leading to suboptimal outcomes. FOMO-driven investments often result in over-concentration in specific assets and over exposure in expensive, illiquid &amp; under performing investments. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><input alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dyedkdjm1/image/upload/v1688392938/jdedkzamhju1kujaxfgl.jpg\" style=\"width: 936px; height: 776px;\" type=\"image\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>How should investors react?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Nudges and FOMO are here to stay. It is a natural human emotion, but managing it is essential to avoid its pitfalls. It is crucial to approach FOMO-driven marketing with a critical mindset. To overcome the potential problems &ndash; transparency, education, and individual empowerment are vital. Individuals should take an active role in their financial decisions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Investors should focus on receiving transparent information, personalised advice, and comprehensive risk assessment.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Look beyond the surface-level information provided by sellers and delve into the details.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Evaluate each product&rsquo;s track record, performance, fees, liquidity, tax and risks.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ask financial product sellers to provide expected post expense and post tax return. Analyse how much return leakage is happening due to expenses and taxes.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ask about the commission being paid to the intermediary/ advisor so that hidden conflicts can be identified.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Define your investment objectives and risk tolerance and let it serve as a guiding framework to assess the suitability of the offered investment products.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Remain disciplined, stick to your predetermined goals, and avoid being enticed by products that don&rsquo;t align with your financial objectives or risk appetite.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Never let go of the long-term view and focus on your investment goals. Remember that successful investing requires patience, discipline, and a steady approach.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Above all, practice mindfulness and self-awareness. Recognise the emotions and psychological biases that can drive FOMO. By being self-aware, you can better control your emotions and make rational decisions based on your financial situation and goals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">So, next time you encounter a phrase like &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get left behind&rdquo;. Remind yourself of another phrase, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump on the Bandwagon&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Best Regards</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Dr. Tarunika Jain Agrawal Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Alpha Research</span></p>\r\n"
